                    is properly placed in square brackets as the title is the editors&#x02BC; invention; it is also misleading, since a version cannot be deemed a &#x201C;sketch&#x201D; that

                    <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>. The correction of the spelling <i>Andernacht</i> 
                        to <i>Andernach</i> in the title was <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s; and indeed, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s spelling carried over to the 
                    <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span> version, his spelling is not shared by British travel guidebooks of the period. 
                    In the <a href="../notes/poems_1886_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1886)</a>, only the

                    and he goes on, like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> pairing poem with prose, to quote an effusion of nationalistic pride in the river by the German&#x2010;American writer, <span class="persName-FL">Francis Lieber</span> (), 
                    written originally for the <span class="date-1829-1833">1829&#x2010;33</span> <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LIEBERENCYCLOPEDIAAMERICANA" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-LIEBERENCYCLOPEDIAAMERICANA"><i>Encyclop√¶dia Americana</i></span></a> (11:15&#x2013;17)

                    This nationalistic pride in the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> as a &#x201C;German&#x201D; river was a comparatively recent cultural development, as was the sentiment surrounding the ruined medieval 
                    castles towering on the romantic heights above the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Middle Rhine</span>. Until well into the eighteenth century, as <span class="persName-RRT">Robert R. Taylor</span> explains, the castles 
                    evoked in Rhinelanders feelings of rivalrous disunity and oppression rather than a unifying national feeling. For each settlement, the river represented 
                    a differently configured boundary and trade artery. Sentiments changed with the development of German Romanticism and taste for the picturesque in the time of <span class="persName-JWG">Goethe</span>, 
                    while a more unified German nationalism accompanied the political realignments defining the <span class="orgName-GERMANCONFEDERATION">German Confederation</span>, which formed after the defeat of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TAYLORCASTLES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Taylor, <i>Castles of the Rhine</i></a>, 24&#x2013;68). In the &#x201C;<span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>&#x201D; section of the 
                    <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> announces some of this <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> sentiment, but he also expresses disappointment in the 
                    unpicturesque commercial traffic on the river. It is in the &#x201C;<span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernacht</span>&#x201D; section (properly spelled <i>Andernach</i>) that he most positively turns 
                    his unfolding travelogue toward the romantic sentiment of the river; its hills, formed from volcanic basalt, which intrigues him; and its picturesque castle ruins.
