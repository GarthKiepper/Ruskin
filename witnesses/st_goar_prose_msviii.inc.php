   <p><span class="placeName-STGOAR">St Goar</span> is the least and sweetest place on all the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. There is <span class="placeName-GODESBERG">Godesberg</span><br/> 
                    with its hilltop crested with ruins, there is <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernacht</span>, with its venerable<br/> 
                    remains of antiquity there is <span class="geogName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span>, on whose cliff never traitor stood<br/> 
                    looking out far away over the <div class="add-above" style="left:10.8em">its</div> sea of rich champaign country, but there<br/> 
                    is nothing like, <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St Goar</span>. It has a lone hill beauty, the little scene round<br/> 
                    it is exceeding small, but it has a modest secluded loveliness, You look<br/> 
                    on <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernacht</span> with veneration, on <span class="geogName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span> with awe, but on <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St<br/> 
                    Goar</span> with love There is a voice in all nature, Speaks it not eloquent&#x2010; <div class="add-above" style="left:18.4em">List to the rave of the mad sea</div><br/> 
                    ly, does it not tell of its green weedy caverns and its coral towers<br/> 
      <span class="del-strikethrough">A</span> and the high hills and shelly vallies far far beneath its cold<br/> 
                    blue, and the skulls of the drowned men that grin from<br/> 
                    among its rolled round pebbles. List to the song of the<br/> 
                    summer breeze and does it not tell of the blue heavens<br/> 
                    and the white clouds and other climes and other seasons<br/> 
                    and spicy gales and myrtle bowers and sweet things far away<br/> 
                    How softly the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> sings at <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St Goar</span>, and it tells of the cold<br/> 
                    arched grottoes of the glacier and the crags of the far <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, and<br/> 
      <span class="del-strikethrough">it</span> how it joys to dash against grey rocks once more.
