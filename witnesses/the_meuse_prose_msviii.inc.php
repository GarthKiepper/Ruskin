   <div class="title" style="text-align:center">The <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span></div>
   
   <p>How <span class="del-strikethrough">be</span> lightly the waves of the broad <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>, crisped<br/> 
                        with the first breath of the morning, as we swept over<br/>
                        the long bridge that crosses the river from <span class="placeName-NAMUR">Namur</span>,<br/> 
                        and looked back on the rich dome of its small, but<br/> 
                        beautiful cathedral,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#LONGBRIDGEGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span> as it began to smile to the<br/> 
                        first glance <span class="del-strikethrough">th</span> of the joyous sun, that was drink&#x2010;<br/> 
                        ing up the delicate mists, which clung to the hills and<br/> 
                        rested <span class="subst-del">i</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">o</span>n the valley in which the fair city reposed<br/> 
                        so peacefully, and then <span class="del-strikethrough">plunged</span> dashed along the<br/> 
                        valley of the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>. I know not, if it was because<br/> 
                        this was our first initiation into the scenery of<br/> 
                        continental rivers, but this part of the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span><br/> 
                        appeared to me infinitely preferable, (not in point<br/> 
                        of sublimity, or immensity but in that romantic<br/> 
                        and picturesque fairy beauty, which is, in many<br/>
                        cases preferable to either) to any thing which I ever<br/> 
                        afterwards saw on the shores of the farfamed <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>.<br/> 
                        There was, to me, a great sameness throughout the whole<br/> 
                        of the &#x2038; <div class="add-above" style="left:2.8em">course of the</div> latter river, and &#x2038; <div class="add-above" style="left:10.0em">as</div> to its fortresses, it is positively too<br/> 
                        much of a good thing, a tiresome repitition of ruins,<br/> 
                        and ruins too, which do not altogether come up to my<br/> 
                        idea of what ruins ought to be,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#TERMINALCOMMA" target="_blank">2</a></span> But for the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>,<br/> 
                        the infinite variety of scenery, the almost confusing<br/> 
                        succession of delightful changes, the impossibility of <span class="del-strikethrough">examining</span> <div class="add-below" style="left:22.8em">seeing</div><br/>
      <div id="MSVIII61r" class="pb"></div>
      <div class="pageNum-top-right">61</div><br/>
      every successive change as you feel that it ought to be seen, and<br/> 
                        finally, the tantalizing rate at which you dash away (capital<br/> 
                        road) from that which you could feast upon, and look upon<br/> 
                        and dwell upon, for&#x2014;ages I was going to say, months, I<br/> 
                        will say, are enough to enchant you with anything.  If you<br/> 
                        wish to see rock scenery in perfection, go to the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#GOTOTHEMEUSEGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span> for<br/> 
                        never were rocks more beautifully disposed, more richly and<br/> 
                        delicately wooded or more finely contrasted with the amaz&#x2010;<br/>
                        ing luxuriance of&#x2038; <div class="add-above" style="left:7.6em">the</div> surrounding scenery. But alas. it was<br/> 
                        but a forenoon ride, and the eve saw us quit the magnificent<br/>
      <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span> with sorrow for the smoky streets and coal wharfs<br/>
                        of <span class="placeName-LIEGE">Liege</span>, and the round, dumpy, shapeless hills of <span class="placeName-SPA">Spa</span>.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#LIEGESPAGLOSS" target="_blank">4</a></span><br/>
