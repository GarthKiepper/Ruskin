   <p>When shall we get up this hill, this intermin&#x2010;
                    <br/>able hill.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_glosses.php#CASSELLSHILLGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span> Bend after bend we have been ascen&#x2010;
                    <br/>ding for the last half hour every successive
                    <br/>turn disclosing a weary length of way, and
                    <br/>those tiresome windmills at the top seem as far
                    <br/>from us as ever. Windmills have long been
                    <br/>celebrated for gesticulation, celebrated with <span class="persName-MDC">Cer&#x2010;
                    <br/>vantes</span> all over the world, but never saw I wind&#x2010;
                    <br/>mills more provokingly alive than at present
                    <br/>with their long stretchy arms bending to the 
                    <br/>breeze that flew over the hilltop, they seemed
                    <br/>beckoning us up ironically, while, the slow<div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">2</a></span>

      <br/>he tramped it up the hill as much encum&#x2010;
                    <br/>bered as a cat with walnut shells, told
                    <br/>us of many a weary moment ere those
                    <br/>becks should, could, or would be obeyed.
                    <br/>We are on the summit, a green plateau
                    <br/>of turf, that looks round on the wide
                    <br/>plains of <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> without a single emin&#x2010;
                    <br/>ence to rival it and few that can obstruct
                    <br/>its view. &#x2014;. Fifteen battle&#x2010;fields are in
                    <br/>view from that spot, telling a fearful tale
                    <br/>of the ready ire of nations, yet looking as
                    <br/>green and peaceful as if they had never
                    <br/>been watered with blood<span class="g-terminal_comma">,&#x2014;</span><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_prose_glosses2.php#TERMINALCOMMA" target="_blank">4</a></span> They say the

                    <br/>the sea certainly is, so I looked in the
                    <br/>direction, and I did see something&#x2014;. I had
                    <br/>some lurking suspicions it was a cloud,
                    <br/>but I chose to believe it was my own <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">Eng&#x2010;
                        <br/>land</span> and it did quite as well to bid fare&#x2010;
                    <br/>well to.&#x2014;<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_prose_glosses2.php#PARAGRAPHBREAKWITHDASH" target="_blank">5</a></span>

      <br/>I love a view like this, for it seems as if you
                    <br/>were looking over all the wide wide world
                    <br/>and were ruling it. Throughout all our
                    <br/>after journey I have seen nothing more
                    <br/>beautiful or more wonderful of its kind
                    <br/>than the view from the little, humble, neg&#x2010;
