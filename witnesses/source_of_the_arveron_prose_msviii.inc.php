   <p>What a delicious thing is a reverie, that total abstraction<br/>
                    from all things present, that stilly dreamy waking vision<br/>
                    that places where you are not, that carries you where you<br/>
                    with tobe, that presents the past to your recollection, and<br/>
                    the future to your fancy, so forcibly, so impressively, so lovelily,<br/>
                    throwing a glow on every circumstance, a halo on every feature<br/>
                    giving the vivid, the magic colouring of the dream to the defined<br/>
                    and distinct recollection of the reality It is thus that I look<br/>
                    back upon our first walk at <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, to the Source of<br/>
                    the <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveron</span>. What variaties of childish beauty we met with<br/>
                    i<span class="subst-del">t</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">n</span> that short walk, every little <span class="del-strikethrough">power</span> mountaineer was a perfect<br/>
                    picture, one little fellow insisted upon conducting us to the source<br/>
                    and as notre guide principale piloted us proudly through the<br/>
                    crowd of little fry who were lying in wait, all expecting <br/>
                    a similar distinction, but who, finding the post of honour<br/>
                    preoccupied, followed <span class="del-strikethrough">grav</span> very gravely, en suite Voila la<br/>
                    source quoth our petit conducteur, as we emerged from<br/>
                    a dark wood of pines bordering on the waves of the flashing<br/>
      <span class="geogName-ARVERON">Arveron</span> It was exceeding lovely. The day had been<br/> 
                    one continued succession of storms but the eve was breaking<br/>
                    and giving fair promise of a <span class="del-strikethrough">clou</span> sunny morrow right<br/>
                    in front a few exhausted, but lingering <span class="del-strikethrough">thundering</span><br/>
                    tempest clouds shadowed the dark masses of pine that<br/>
                    girdle the Montanvert, but farther <span class="del-strikethrough">the</span> to the <span class="del-strikethrough">whe</span> west<br/>
                    broke away into fleecy masses scarcely distinguishable from<br/>
                    the eternal snow that flashed through their openings and farther<br/>
                    still a serene evening sky glowed peacefully A lurid ominous<br/>
                    light pervaded the whole air, that stormy and murky lume<br/>
                    the effect of the strange combat between the sun and tempest<br/>
                    the one casting the whole body of <span class="del-strikethrough">mo</span> gigantic mountains into<br/>

      <div class="pageNum-top-right">55</div><br/>
                    a dreary darkness, the other <span class="del-strikethrough">shootin</span> pouring a stream of red ghostly<br/>
      <span class="del-strikethrough">bu</span> dusky light up the valley that caught as it past the projecting<br/>
                        pinnacled spires of the <span class="geogName-BOSSONS">glacier des Bossons</span> which flashed dazzling<br/>
                    forth from the gloom of the ribbed crags as the lightming leaps<br/>
                    from the thunder cloud A low hollow melancholy echoing was<br/>
                    heard issuing from the recesses of the mountains, the last sighing<br/>
                    of the passing away tempest the last murmers of the storm<br/>
                    spirit as he yielded up his reign, it past away and the<br/>
                    blue rigidness of the transparent <span class="del-strikethrough">grotto</span> cavern of the glacier<br/>
                    woke rosily to the kiss of the departing sun
