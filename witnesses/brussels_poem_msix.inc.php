      <span class="l">The racking clouds were fleeting fast</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Upon the bosom of the blast<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#RACKINGCLOUDS" target="_blank">1</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">In wild confusion fiercely driven</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Fled they across the face of heaven</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The fitful gust came shrieking high,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The rattling rain flew driving by</span><br/>
      <span class="l">But where the horizon stretched away</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Towards the couch of parting day</span><br/>
      <span class="l">A streak of paly light was seen</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The heaped and darkling clouds between</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Against that light, for time full brief</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX21v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l"><span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> arose in dark relief</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Colossal on the western fire</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Seemed massive tow&#x02BC;r and slender spire</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Nearer, and nearer as we drew</span><br/>
      <span class="l">More strongly marked the outlines grew,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Till of the buildings, you might see,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Distinct the Gothic tracerie</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The drawbridge rung, we passed the gate,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#DRAWBRIDGE" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">And regal <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> entered straight</span><br/>
      <span class="l">It stirs, to see the human tide</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That marks a city in its pride</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That fitful oceans eddying sweep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Is still more changeful than the deep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">For those dark billows as they roll</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Mark movements of the human soul.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Yet in that city, there was none,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of that confused and busy hum,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That tells of traffic, and of trade</span><br/>
      <span class="l">No, <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> time of pow&#x02BC;r was sped</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Yet in her streets was something seen</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Spoke what the city once had been</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX22r" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">Our rapid course as now we wheel</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where rose the huge hotel de ville<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#HOTELDEVILLEGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">The noble spires proportions high</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Stood forth upon the cloudy sky,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In all its fretted majesty</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And his last light the sun had sent</span><br/>
      <span class="l">On buttress and on battlement</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That while the houses were arrayed</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In all the depth of twilight shade,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Yet shot there faint a yellow glow</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where the tall arches shafted show</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Glimmered a moment there the ray,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Then fainter grew, and past away</span><br/>
      <span class="l"><span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, thy battlements have been</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of many an action strange the scene</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Thou sawst on Julys dreadful night<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#JULYSDREADFULNIGHTGLOSS" target="_blank">4</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">The veterans rushing to the fight</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Thou heardest when the word was spoken</span><br/>
      <span class="l">At midnight thy repose was broken</span><br/>
      <span class="l">By tramp of men and neigh of steed</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Battalions bursting forth to bleed</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX22v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">Till the dark phalanx waving crest</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Forth from thy gates was forward prest</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And breaking with the morning mild</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The disant roar of battle wild.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And later still the rabble shout</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And revolutions riot rout</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Leaving such marks as long shall tell</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of dark destruction fierce and fell.</span><br/>
      </span>
