   <p>What is it that makes the very heart leap within you<br/> 
                        at the sight of a hills blue outline, that so aetheriallizes the<br/> 
                        soul and ennobles the spirit that so raises you from the<br/>

      earth an<span class="subst-del">f</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">d</span> from aught of the earth Ist it their apparent proximity<br/> 
                        to the blue heavens inaccessibleness, is it the humbling sense<br/> 
                        of your own littleness, or that immoveable unchangeable mag<br/>nificence of th<span class="subst-del">e</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">at</span> <span class="del-strikethrough"><span class="unclear-DCH">pa</span></span> which has seen the beginning of the world<br/> 
                        and will see its end, or is it that the thoughts range insens&#x2010;<br/> ibly from the things created to him who created them. I<br/> 
                        know not How it thrilled through me when first, far away<br/> 
                        across the lake like swell of the <span class="del-strikethrough">blue</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:14.0em">deep</div> waters of that wondrous<br/> 
                        river rose the cloudy outline of the blue mountains Long time<br/> 
                        has past over me since I saw the swell of a blue hill I have<br/> 
                        longed for them, I have yearned for them as an exile yearns<br/> 
                        for his native land, and I am with them, &#x2014;. We left <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Co&#x2010;<br/> logne</span> on a misty summer morning, its many turreted spires<br/> 
                        rising colossally but grey and faint amid the wreathing<br/> 
                        columns of mist that smoked upward from the course<br/> 
                        of the Broad <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. There was the huge cathedral, dark<br/> 
                        with the confused richness of its own fretwork, and the<br/> 
                        remains of its magnificent but unfinished tower show&#x2010;<br/> ing ruinlike beside it There were the red sails and<br/> 
                        mingled masts of the innumerable shipping without<br/> 
                        one sail swelling or a flag bending to the morning breeze<br/>
                        There was that peaceful and lovely lassitude over every<br/> 
                        thing that sleep of the earth and the air and the<br/> 
                        sky that charms the mind into a corresponding fascin&#x2010;<br/> ation of stillness, the very thoughts seem at rest.<br/>

   <p>We went on we past <span class="placeName-BONN">Bonne</span> and <span class="placeName-GODESBERG">Godesberg</span>, and<br/> 
      <span class="geogName-DRACHENFELS">Drachenfels</span> and sunset was <span class="del-strikethrough"><span class="unclear-DCH">bending</span></span> <div class="add-above" style="left:11.2em">sorrowing</div> over hill and<br/> 
                    valley when the gloomy and venerable towers of <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Ander&#x2010;<br/> nacht</span> frowned over us. I love to look upon the crags that<br/> 
      <span class="persName-JULIUSCAESAR">Caesar</span> has scaled, on<span class="del-strikethrough">t</span> the towers that his legions hav<span class="subst-del">i</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">e</span><span class="subst-del-strikethrough">ng</span> founded.<br/>

                    The one is now as it was then, looking up to the broad blue heaven, the others<br/> 
      <span class="subst-del">is</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">are</span> in ruins.&#x2014; Yet <span class="del-strikethrough">it</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:8.0em">they</div> is here, mighty in <span class="del-strikethrough">its</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:17.2em">their</div> ruin, and majestic in <span class="del-strikethrough">its</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:27.6em">their</div><br/>
