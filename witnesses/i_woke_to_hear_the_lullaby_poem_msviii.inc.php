   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">I woke to hear the lullaby
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">520</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of the <span class="del-strikethrough">fie</span> swift river rolling by</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Monotonous yet beautiful</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Ever <span class="del-strikethrough"><span class="unclear-DCH">t</span></span> the gentle pebbly <span class="del-strikethrough">swift</span> swell"</span><br/> 
      <span class="l"><span class="del-strikethrough">Of ever</span> And every ripple lent his plash</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Joining in chorus wi<span class="subst-del">f</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">t</span>h the dash 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">525</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of <span class="del-strikethrough">m</span> every mighty mountain stream</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That joyful sung his morning hymn</span><br/>
      <span class="l">His iris glory round him quivering</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where his white showery falls were shivering</span><br/>
      <span class="l">There is a melancholy smile
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">530</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">On natures features fair the while</span><br/>
      <span class="l">When the dank dews descending grey</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Weep for the loss of parting day</span><br/>
      <span class="l">There is a sad and soft complaining</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In the light breeze when day is waning
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">535</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">The evening star is fair and full</span><br/>
      <span class="l">But it is passing sorrowful<span class="del-strikethrough">l</span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">And merry is the laughing light</span><br/>
      <div id="MSVIIIp55v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">That blushes oer the heavens height</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That stream and bird and <span class="del-strikethrough"><span class="unclear-DCH">for</span></span> breeze and tree
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">540</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l"><span class="del-strikethrough">V</span> For very joy sing merrily</span><br/>
      <span class="l">When wakes the morn the morn the mountain snows</span><br/>
      <span class="l">From their cold fixed pale repose</span><br/>
      <span class="l">It was a most enchanting vision</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The morning mists had upwards risen
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">545</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">And floating in the fields of air</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Lay in long lines most calmly there</span><br/>
      <span class="l">You could not call them clouds I wist</span><br/>
      <span class="l">They were not smoke they were not mist</span><br/>
      <span class="l">They were a sort of visible breeze
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">550</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Touching the tops of the pine trees</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That as we passed beneath, and strook</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Their stretchy branches ever shook</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The laughing showers of <span class="del-underline">lightso</span> dancing dew</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Reflecting every rainbow hue 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">555</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Or clinging to the clusters dank</span><br/>
      <span class="l">of bright green moss upon the bank</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And where those pines their crests had cloven</span><br/>
      <span class="l">How rich the sun was interwoven</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And smiling through the leafy shade
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">560</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Among the spangled grass it played</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And drank the dew from flower and blade</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Melting the heavy drops to air</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That so dragged down the gossamer</span><br/>
      </span>
   
</div>
