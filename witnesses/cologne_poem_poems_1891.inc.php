      <span class="l">T<span class="smallcaps">HE</span> noon was past, the sun was low,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Yet still we felt his arid glow;</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">From the red sand, reflected glare</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Deadened the breeze, and fired the air.</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">The open sky was misty grey;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The clouds in mighty masses lay,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">That, heaped on the horizon high,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Marked <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alpine</span> outlines on the sky.</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Long had we toiled to gain a brow<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#GAINABROWGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">On which we stood triumphant now,</span><br/> 
      
      <span class="l">While the white mist was certain sign</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where took his course the mighty <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>.</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Hills in the distant haze were seen,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#SIEBENGEBIRGEGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/> 
      <span class="l">And wide expanse of plain between,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Whose desert length, without a tree,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Was stretched in vast monotony.</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">We drove adown that hill amain;</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">We past along the shadeless plain;</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Rested we now where, uncontrolled,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">The <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> his bursting billows rolled;</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">And ever, ever fierce and free</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Bore broadly onward to the sea.</span><br/>
