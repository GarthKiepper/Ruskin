      <span class="l">The way was long and yet twas sweet.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Through many a shady soft retreat</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where the broad willow semblance gave</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of weeping beauty to the wave</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And elm with massy foliage prest</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And feathery aspens quivering crest</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And many a spiry poplar glade</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And hazels rich entangled shade</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While onward as advancing still</span><br/>
      <span class="l">From <span class="placeName-STOMER">Omars</span> plain<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_glosses.php#STOMERSPLAINGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span> to <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassels</span> hill<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_glosses.php#CASSELLSHILLGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/>

      <span class="l">Far yet more far the landscape threw</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Its deep immeasurable blue</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Oh beautiful those plains were showing</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where summer sun was hotly glowing</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Many a battle field lay spread</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Once the dark dwelling of the dead</span><br/>
      <span class="l">But fruitful now their champaigns wave</span><br/>
      <span class="l">With bending grain on soldiers grave.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While far beneath in long array</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The priestly orders wound their way<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_glosses.php#PRIESTLYORDERSGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Heavy the massive banners rolled</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rich wrought with gems and stiff with gold</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While as the cross came borne on high</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Beneath its crimson canopy</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Many the haughty head that bowed</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Sunk his high crest the warrior proud</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The priest his glance benignant cast</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And murmured blessings as he past</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While round the hillside echoing free</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rung the loud hymning melody</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Many a monkish voice was there</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX16v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">Many a trumpet rent the air</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And softer, sweeter yet the same</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The sounds in failing cadence came</span><br/>
      <span class="l">No marvel that the pomp and pride</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of Romes religion thus should hide</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The serpent folds beneath that roll</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The poison mantling in the bowl.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cassel_glosses.php#NOMARVEL" target="_blank">4</a></span></span><br/>
