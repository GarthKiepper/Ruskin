      <span class="l"><span class="del-strikethrough">The</span> <span class="del-strikethrough">OH</span> The morn looked bright on<span class="del-strikethrough">er</span> hill and dale</span><br/>
      <span class="l">As we left the walls of merry <span class="unclear-">d√ºgle</span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">And towards the long hill ridges around </span><br/>
      <span class="l">That ramparted the plains around 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">780</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">That greener growing, as we neared </span><br/>
      <span class="l">At length with meadows decked appeared </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Fair as our fields in May; and then </span><br/>
      <div id="MSVIII61v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">We entered on a little glen 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">780</div> </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Those miniature <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> among,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">All smiling with a morning sun </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Grassy, and woody, and most sweet </span><br/>
      <span class="l">As ever fairy her retreat </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Formed for her midnight dances. Through 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">785</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Tracing, in mazy winds anew,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The spots it had passed o'er, as fain </span><br/>
      <span class="l">To run its sweet course o'er again,&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Flowed a small tributary stream </span><br/>
      <span class="l">That the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> levied all between 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">790</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">The frontlets of the fair fresh hills </span><br/>
      <span class="l"><span class="subst-del-strikethrough">Sprang</span><div class="subst-add-above" style="left:1.2em">Leaped</div> merrily the glad young rills, </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Smiling in silver as they sprang, </span><br/>
      <span class="l">And merry were the notes they sang, </span><br/>
      <span class="l">For they were joyful at their birth 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">795</div></span><br/>
      <span class="l">From the cold prisons of the earth </span><br/>
      <span class="l">To the warm sun and open sky, </span><br/>
      <span class="l">And their song was all of liberty </span><br/>
      <span class="l">But the dell narrowed as we went </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Till, 'twixt the promontories pent 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">800</div></span><br/><div id="" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">It upward ran, and the clear stream </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Now forward shot its banks between, </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Fast flashing, till from the obscure </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Emerged we on a lofty moor, </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Open, and shelterless, and bare, 
         <div class="linenumber-right-JR">805</div></span><br/> 
      <span class="l">And gently undulating far </span><br/>
      <span class="l">With here and there a patch of pine </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Breaking the smoothness of its line,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Toward the south horizon!</span><br/>
      </span>
