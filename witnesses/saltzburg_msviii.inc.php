      <span class="l">The sun <span class="del-strikethrough">is</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:3.6em">was</div> low on Salzas silver deep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Broad loom<span class="overwriting">ed</span> the lofty city in its sleep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Dome over dome in arched array was set</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Spire over spire and sparkling minaret,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">How red you saw the swarthy sunset shine</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where <span class="subst-del">huge</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">rose</span> St Ruperts mighty marble shrine</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rich with the spoils of many a Hartzwald mine</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Crag <span class="del-strikethrough">heaped</span> poised on crag, with each its battlement</span><br/>
      <span class="l"><span class="subst-del">That</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">The</span> Fortress reared its dark and huge ascent<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/saltzburg_glosses.php#TRANSPOSITIONGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">From its foundation lifted like a cloud,</span><br/>
      <span class="l"><span class="del-strikethrough">Silent and</span> <div class="add-below" style="left:0.4em"><span class="subst-del">But moveless</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">But moveless&#x2014;</span></div> changeless, beautifully proud,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Shadow imbued with sunbeams like a veil,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Clasps the wide city, wreathes its outlines pale</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And mingles roof with roof and tower with towr,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Twilights soft magic brooding oer the hour,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Mysterious beauty upon all seen there</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And all unseen, imagined passing fair.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Oh what can break the still, at even shed,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Just as the sun displays his parting red</span><br/>
      <span class="l">There is no sound that comes not sweetly by</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">When the last lights upon the landscape die,</span><br/>
      <span class="l"><span class="del-strikethrough">Loud shouts</span> <div class="add-margin_left"><span class="space" style="padding-left:-1.2em"> </span>Low chaunts</div><span class="add-overwriting">Low chaunts</span> the fisher where the waters pour,</span><br/><span class="space" style="padding-left:-1.2em"> </span>
      <span class="l">And murmuring voices come along the shore,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And many a plash of wave upon the side,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of yon dark boat that slumbers on the tide</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And there are sounds from city &#x0026; from hill</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Shore, forest, flood, &#x0026; field, yet all <span class="del-scratchout"><span class="unclear-blotted-"></span></span> <div class="add-above" style="left:15.2em">seems</div><span class="add-overwriting">seems</span> still.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">I left the shore, and ere the nights descent</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Through huge St Ruperts massive portal went,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Full many a marble there of changing hue,</span><br/>
      <div id="MSVIII81v-82r" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">Chiselled &#x0026; fretted, walled the temple through</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Successive altars lit with incensed flame</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rose through the chapels, none without a name</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And the worn pavement every shrine before</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of long devotion certain witness bore</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And there was many a statue nobly wrought</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And many a <span class="del-strikethrough"><span class="unclear-incomplete_word-">sta</span></span> painting from the southward brought</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Planned by those master minds, that ever stand</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The life, the glory, of their native land</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And, as hard rock, that mid some softer stone,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Stands from the rest, unbuttressed, &#x0026; alone</span><br/>
      <span class="l">A bulwark, rears its iron strength for aye,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The <span class="del-strikethrough">weaker</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:1.6em">while soft</div> crag around it wears away,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/saltzburg_glosses.php#SUBSTITUTIONGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">So shall their memory lift itself at last,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Forth from the ruins of the aeras past</span><br/>
      <span class="l">So, like some lofty beacon, constant shine,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Distinctly <span class="del-strikethrough">seen amid</span> <div class="add-above" style="left:4.4em">glowing <span class="unclear-">thro</span></div>  the mist of time</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The vesper hymn was singing, as the night</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rolled round the temple, veiling from the sight</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The mighty dome so high and heavenward piled</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Beneath whose concave slumbers Scotlands child</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The Good St Rupert, &#x0026; full silently</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Star after <span class="subst-del">sky</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">star</span> was scattered on the sky</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And I forgot the city, as I gazed</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Where thousand worlds through all the midnight blazed,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And I held through them commune with the heaven.</span><br/>
      </span>
