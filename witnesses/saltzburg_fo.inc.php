   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">O<span class="smallcaps">n</span> Salza&#x02BC;s quiet tide the westering sun</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Gleams mildly; and the lengthening shadows dun,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Chequered with ruddy streaks from spire and roof,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Begin to weave fair twilight&#x02BC;s mystic woof,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Till the dim tissue, like a gorgeous veil,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Wraps the proud city, in her beauty pale.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">A minute since, and in the rosy light</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Dome, casement, spire, were glowing warm and bright;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">A minute since, St. Rupert&#x02BC;s stately shrine,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rich with the spoils of many a Hartzwald mine,</span><br/><span id="">The dome of the Cathedral of St. Hubert is covered with copper; 
                        and there are many altars and shrines in the interior constructed of different sorts of marble, brought from quarries in the vicinity. 
                        St. Hubert, to whom the Cathedral is dedicated, was by birth a Scotchman. &#x005B;Ruskin&#x02BC;s note.&#x005D;</span><br><br>
      <span class="l">Flung back the golden glow: now, broad and vast,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The shadows from yon ancient fortress cast,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Like the dark grasp of some barbaric power,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Their leaden empire stretch o&#x02BC;er roof and tower.</span><br/>
      </span>
   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">Sweet is the twilight hour by Salza&#x02BC;s strand,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Though no Arcadian visions grace the land:</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Wakes not a sound that floats not sweetly by,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While day&#x02BC;s last beams upon the landscape die;</span><br/>
      <div id="??? p. 38" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">Low chants the fisher where the waters pour,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And murmuring voices melt along the shore;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The plash of waves comes softly from the side</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of passing barge slow gliding o&#x02BC;er the tide;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And there are sounds from city, field, and hill,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Shore, forest, flood; yet mellow all and still.</span><br/>
      </span>
   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">But change we now the scene, ere night descend,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And through St. Rupert&#x02BC;s massive portal wend.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Full many a shrine, bedeckt with sculpture quaint</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of steel&#x2010;clad knight and legendary saint;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Full many an altar, where the incense&#x2010;cloud</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rose with the pealing anthem, deep and loud;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And pavements worn before each marble fane</span><br/>
      <span class="l">By knees devout&#x2014;(ah! bent not all in vain!)</span><br/>
      <span class="l">There greet the gaze; with statues, richly wrought,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And noble paintings, from Ausonia brought,&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Planned by those master minds whose memory stands</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The grace, the glory, of their native lands.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">As the hard granite, &#x02BC;midst some softer stone,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Starts from the mass, unbuttressed and alone,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And proudly rears its iron strength for aye,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While crumbling crags around it melt away;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">So, midst the ruins of long eras gone,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Creative Genius holds his silent throne,&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">While lesser lights grow dim,&#x2014;august, sublime,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Gigantic looming o&#x02BC;er the gulfs of Time!</span><br/>
      </span>
