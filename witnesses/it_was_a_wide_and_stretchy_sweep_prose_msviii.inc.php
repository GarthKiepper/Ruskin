   <p>It was a wide stretchy sweep of lovely blue champaign, richly <br/>
                   cultivated and beautifully wooded, and bounded by magnificent <br/>
                   mountain ranges: here fading away, faint and blue &#x0026; cloudlike <br/>
                   toward the south, there distinct and near and lofty, with the <br/>
                   green cultivation climbing up their broad flanks. I had read, that <br/>
                   the snowy summit of the <span class="geogName-MONTTITLIS">Mont Titlis</span>, was visible from <span class="placeName-STRASBURG">Strasburg</span>, <br/>
                   the consequence of which marvellous information was, that I metamor&#x2013; <br/>
                   phosed every cloud I saw into a mountain, strained my eyes <br/>
                   with looking for that which was out of sight, and had at last <br/>
                   very nearly argued myself into a conviction, that blue hills <br/>
                   were white ones until our entrance into the narrow dell above <br/>
                   mentioned precluded all farther observations upon the clouds. &#x2014; <br/>
                   A swiss Cottage is a celebrated thing, celebrated far and wide &#x2014; <br/>
                   it has modelled the Tivolian villas of&#x2014;<span class="placeName-HIGHTGATE">Highgate</span> and <span class="placeName-HAMPSTEAD">Hamp <br/>
                   stead</span>, the mock waterfalls and crocodile stools of the Coliseum <br/>
                   have extended its fame, and much it delighted me when first <br/>
                   the wide projecting wooden roof and carved galleries and external <br/>
                   stairs looked out to greet us from among the dark pines. What <br/>
                   a host of associations and recollections tumbled in upon me. <br/>
                   Mountains avalanches, glaciers, cottages, <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>, vinegar. Tell, <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> <br/>
                   apples, tyrants, and crossbows came crowding into my brain, jumbled <br/>
                   together in most admired disorder, I thought of nothing connected <br/>
                        the whole day.
