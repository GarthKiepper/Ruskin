   <p>Passeport, Monsieur, s&#x02BC;il vous plait&#x2014;. I hate

                    <br/>like prisons, their population, like so many rats
                    <br/>in a rat trap, they are arduous to get in,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_prose_glosses2.php#GETIN" target="_blank">2</a></span> dif&#x2010;
                    <br/>ficult to get out, and disagreeable to remain in.
                    <br/>To all this however, <span class="placeName-LILLE">Lille</span> is an exception, except in
                    <br/>one circumstance, its difficulty of access.&#x2014; We were
                    <br/>detained after a long days journey, under a bur<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_prose_glosses2.php#WORDDIVISIONBURNING" target="_blank">3</a></span>
      <br/>ning sun, hot, hungry, and stupid, while our
                    <br/>passport was examined. Slowly the sentinel<div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">4</a></span>
      <br/>unfolded the paper, spelled over its contents with
                    <br/>tiresome coolness, and provoking minuteness
                    <br/>slowly returned it, and then came&#x2014; Passez.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_glosses.php#PASSPORT" target="_blank">5</a></span>
      <br/>And pass we did, right gladly.&#x2014; <span class="placeName-LILLE">Lille</span> is a

      <br/>beautiful, a most beautiful town,&#x2014; I have seen
                    <br/>none equal to it, for grandeur of effect, for the
                    <br/>massive magnificence, of its edifices, for the pal&#x2010;

                    <br/>day also on which we entered it was almost
                    <br/>Italian, the sky was of such a deep and unbro&#x2010;
                    <br/>ken blue, and a stream of rich, glowing, tawny

                    <br/>carving, of the upper parts of the houses &#x2014; but
                    <br/>their bases, owing to the narrowness of the streets
                    <br/>and the enormous height of the opposing build&#x2010;
                    <br/>ings, were wrapt in shade, deep, gloomily deep
                    <br/>when contrasted with the flood of sunshine, that
                    <br/>glanced on the gable roofs, and almost gave to
