      <span class="l">A figure. <span class="doubleletter-fill">Y</span>es it is for on the tops of shops</span><br/>
      <span class="l">We often see a figure with two wings</span><br/>
      <span class="l">A scythe upon one shoulder and a lock</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of hair upon his forehead while his head is bald</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Except the lock upon his forehead and called time</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Times very quick and therefore he has wings</span><br/>
      <span class="l">When past times gone for ever so he has a lock</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of hair upon his forehead and the proverb is</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Take time by his forelock he mows down every thing</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And so he has a scythe time is so quick</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That might a year be called a day</span><br/>

      <span class="l">A happy <span class="date-1827-01-01">new years day</span> to you papa</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And now I must return to time</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Is time only a figure no he is not</span><br/>
      <span class="l">What is he then what is he I dont know</span><br/>
      <span class="l">He&#x02BC;s not a quality of that I&#x02BC;m sure</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Oh I remember now he is a god</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Entitled <span class="caps">S</span>aturn he&#x02BC;s a heathen god</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And well he might be called one none but they</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Could go so quick or jump from tween our hands</span><br/>
      <span class="l">As time does,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/time_blank_verse_glosses.php#BASELINEPUNCTUATIONGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span> time I&#x02BC;m quite away from him</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Away from him no surely I&#x02BC;m not so</span><br/>
      <span class="l">For I&#x02BC;m at heathen gods and he&#x02BC;s a god</span><br/>
      <span class="l">So though I may be from him I&#x02BC;m not far</span><br/>
      <span class="l">From him and now I must go to him quite</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Tis but an hour to merry <span class="date-1827-01-01"><span class="caps">N</span>ewyearsday</span><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/time_blank_verse_glosses.php#NEWYEARSDAYSPACEDGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">For though it is a&#x2010;day a&#x2010;day&#x02BC;s an hour</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And what&#x02BC;s an hour &#x02BC;tis only a wee minute</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Made so by the quick course of time</span><br/>
      <span class="l">So mr time as I&#x02BC;ve said all about you</span><br/>
      <span class="l">All I&#x02BC;ve to say I must take leave of you</span><br/>
