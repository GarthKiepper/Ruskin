      <span class="l">Upon the bosom of the blast;<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#RACKINGCLOUDS" target="_blank">1</a></span></span><br/>
      <div id="" class="pb"></div><span class="l">In wild confusion fiercely driven</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Fled they across the face of heaven.</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">The fitful gust came shrieking high;</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">The rattling rain flew driving by;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">But where the horizon stretched away</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Towards the couch of parting day,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">A streak of paly light was seen,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The heaped and darkling clouds between.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Against that light, for time full brief,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l"><span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> arose in dark relief.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Colossal on the western fire</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Seemed massive tow&#x02BC;r and slender spire.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Nearer, and nearer as we drew,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">More strongly marked the outlines grew,</span><br/> 
      <span class="l">Till of the buildings you might see</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Distinct, the Gothic tracerie.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The drawbridge rung,&#x2014;we passed the gate,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#DRAWBRIDGE" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/> 
      <span class="l">And regal <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> entered straight.</span><br/>
      </span>
   
   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">It stirs, to see the human tide</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That marks a city in its pride!</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That fitful ocean&#x02BC;s eddying sweep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Is still more changeful than the deep:</span><br/>
      <span class="l">For those dark billows as they roll</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Mark movements of the human soul.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Yet in that city there was none</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Of that confused and busy hum,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That tells of traffic and of trade;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">No, <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>&#x02BC; time of power was sped:</span><br/>
      <div id="" class="pb"></div><span class="l">Yet in her streets was something seen</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Spoke what the city once had been.</span><br/>

   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">Our rapid course as now we wheel</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where rose the huge HÃ´tel de ville,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#HOTELDEVILLEGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">The noble spire&#x02BC;s proportions high</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Stood forth upon the cloudy sky</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In all its fretted majesty:</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And his last light the sun had sent</span><br/>
      <span class="l">On buttress and on battlement;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That, while the houses were arrayed</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In all the depth of twilight shade,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Yet shot there, faint, a yellow glow</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where the tall arches shafted show;&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Glimmered a moment there the ray,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Then fainter grew, and past away.</span><br/>

      <span class="l"><span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, thy battlements have been</span><br/>

      <span class="l">The veterans rushing to the fight:&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Thou heardest when the word was spoken;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">At midnight thy repose was broken</span><br/>
      <span class="l">By tramp of men and neigh of steed,&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Battalions bursting forth to bleed;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Till the dark phalanx&#x02BC; waving crest</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Forth from thy gates was forward prest,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And breaking with the morning mild</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The distant roar of battle wild.</span><br/>
      <div id="" class="pb"></div><span class="l">And, later still, the rabble shout,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And revolution&#x02BC;s riot rout;</span><br/>

      <span class="l">Of dark destruction fierce and fell.</span><br/>
