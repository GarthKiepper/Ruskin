                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSKLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:364 n. 1). 
                        According to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref>, 
                        while staying at Cadenabbia, the Ruskins visited a number of villas on Lake Como where they could have admired terraced gardens extending down to the lakeside, 
                        such as Villa Sommariva and Villa Melzi<!-- Melzi already in crib -->
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, 43-45). In the drawing, the horizontal arched structure extending to the right of the terraces 
                        also suggests Villa Pliniana, which the Ruskins visited, and which is built directly on the water as this drawing indicates. 
                        The main building of that villa, left of the horizontal wall, is not terraced, however, but presents a sheer, multi-story wall extending vertically straight up from the lakeside. 
                        Ruskin's drawing may represent a fantasy villa, compounded of various memories and/or sketches made on the spot of villa architecture surrounding the Italian lakes. 
                        The drawing also appears to be influenced by J. M. W. Turner's vignettes for the 1830 illustrated edition of Samuel Rogers's Italy, 
                        such as <title type="artwork" corresp="#JMWTAVILLAMOONLIGHT">"A Villa, Moonlight"</title> or <title type="artwork" corresp="#JMWTFAREWELLLAKECOMO">"Lake of Como"</title>. 
                        The former illustrates Rogers's poem, <title type="artwork" corresp="#ROGERSTHEFELUCA">"The Feluca"</title> (set near Genoa, on the seacoast, not on the lakes), 
                        and the latter illustrates the closing poem, <title type="artwork" corresp="#ROGERSAFAREWELL">"A Farewell"</title> (composed at Susa, near Turin, according to a footnote 
                        hanging from the title). If the "farewell" is imagined to be written at Susa, the speaker would be departing Italy via the pass of Mont Cenis, which had served as the most 
                        popular and accessible route both entering and departing Italy thoughout the eighteenth century 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BLACKITALY">Black, <hi rend="italic">Italy and the Grand Tour</hi></ref>, 27-30). 
                        In fact, Rogers entered Italy on his 1822-23 tour via the Simplon Pass, which then surpassed the Mont Cenis Pass in popularity owing to the convenience of Napoleon's carriage road, 
                        and he departed via the Brenner Pass into Austria. Moreover, despite placing the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSCOMO">"Como"</title> following the speaker's descent 
                        into Italy in the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">"The Alps"</title>, Rogers's actual experience of the Italian lakes was confined to the shores of Lake Maggiore, 
                        from whence he traveled directly to Milan, and then went on to Verona, Padua, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome, and Naples
