   <p><span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> is a lovely, a queenlike city from a distance, sweeping<br/>
                    up the flanks of its hill, battlement over battlement swelling up,<br/>
                    higher and higher and higher, and the massive darkness of the two<br/> 
                    huge square cathedral towrs looming over the <span class="subst-del">l</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">w</span>ole and contrasted<br/> 
                    strangely with the delicate sharp spireness of the steeple of the <span class="title-architecture-HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">hotel de <div class="runover" style="left:26.4em">ville</span><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#CATHEDRALHOTELDEVILLEGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span><br/>

                    <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span> would look like an assemblage of brick kilns beside<br/> 
                    it.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#PARISBRICKKILNSGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span> We saw <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> at 11 miles distance, its spires rising<br/> 
                    dark and spearlike out of the horizon&#x2014; It was waxing dark<br/>
                    as we entered the city, and the lights began to twinkle in the<br/>
                    few, the very few shop windows. I love to pass through a city<br/> 
      <span class="del-strikethrough">by</span> at night, the hum of the voices rises so softly out of<br/> 
                    the obscurity, and the figures flit about dark and batlike and<br/>
                    the cold starlight mingles so strangely with the red swarthy<br/> 
                    gleam of the lamps <span class="del-strikethrough">light</span>,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_prose_glosses2.php#LAMPLIGHT" target="_blank">3</a></span> and when you look up, the narrow<br/> 
                    strip of sky is of such a dark dark blue, you may see it<br/> 
                    appear to quiver with the starlight if you look long, and the<br/> 
                    white housefronts rise so ghastly so ghostlike against <span class="subst-del">,</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">i</span>t, and<br/>
                    the windows seem grinning maliciously askan<span class="subst-del">t</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">ce</span> at you, It makes<br/> 
                    one shiver <u>to</u> think of it.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/brussels_glosses.php#WAXINGDARKGLOSS" target="_blank">4</a></span> Cities are exceedingly picturesque when built<br/> 
                    upon hills, but for exploring, for circumnavigating, for <span class="del-strikethrough">traversing</span>,<br/>
