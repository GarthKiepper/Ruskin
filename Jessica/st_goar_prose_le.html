      <p><span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span> is the least and sweetest place on all the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>. There is 
                <span class="placeName-GODESBERG">Godesberg</span> with its hilltop crested with <span class="placeName-GODESBURG">ruins</span>, there is <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernacht</span> with its 
                venerable remains of antiquity, there is <span class="placeName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span> upon whose cliff 
                never traitor stood, looking out far away over its rich sea of champaign, 
                yet there is nothing like <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>. It has a lone hill beauty, the little 
                scene around it is exceedingly small, but it has a modest secluded loveliness. 
                You look on <span class="placeName-ANDERNACH">Andernacht</span> with veneration, on <span class="placeName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span> with 
                awe, but on <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span> with love.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/st_goar_glosses_contextual.php#STGOARLOVEGLOSS" target="_blank""
            class="inactive">1</a></span></p> 
      
      <p>There is a voice in all nature. List to the rave of the mad sea; speaks 
                it not eloquently; does it not tell of its green weedy caverns and its coral 
                towers, and the high hills and shelly vallies far, far beneath its cold blue?<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/st_goar_glosses_contextual.php#STGOARSKULLSGLOSS" target="_blank""
            class="inactive">2</a></span><div id="" class="pb"></div>
                List to the song of the summer breeze; does it not tell of the blue heavens, 
                and the white clouds and other climes, and other seasons, and spicy gales, 
                and myrtle bowers, and sweet things far away? How sweetly the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> 
                sings at <span class="placeName-STGOAR">St. Goar</span>, and it tells of the arched grottoes of the glacier, and 
                the crags of the far <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, and how it joys to dash against tall rocks once 
                more.
