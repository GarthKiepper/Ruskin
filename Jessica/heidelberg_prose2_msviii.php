      <p>The <span class="placeName-building-HEIDELBERGCASTLE">castle of Heidelberg</span> is exceeding desolate.  Armies<br/>
                    have razed its foundations, the thunder hath riven its<br/>
                            towers and there is no sound in its courts, and the<br/>
                    wind is still in the open galleries.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#DESOLATE" target="_blank"" class="inactive">1</a></span> The grass is very green<br/>
                            on the floor of the hall of the banquet, and the wild<br/>
                            birds build their nests in the watchtowers, and they<br/>
                            dwell in the dwellings of man, for they are forsaken<br/> 
                            and left and there is no voice there &#x2014; there is no<br/>
                            complaining in the dungeon, and where is the voice of<br/> 
                            gladness in the hall.  It is a ruin, a ruin, a<br/>
                            desolate ruin, the husbandman sees it on the height of<br/>

                            if he should grieve that there power is past away.<br/>
         I know not how it is, but all nations in all ages<br/>
