                    <lb/>ted to us, for when we take the church
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> at its beginning, and see it go&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing from strength to strength, daily &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>rapidly increasing <del rend="strikethrough">among</del> in the midst
                    <lb/> of all endeavours to suppress it, we un
                    <lb/>derstand more of its institutions, and of
                    <lb/>the Providence which wrought it up
                    <lb/>than we could possibly do, if we on
                    <lb/>ly considered it in its present ma

                    <lb/>We must first, in order fully to under
                    <lb/>stand this subject, remember the condit
                    <lb/>ion of the Israelites, before <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>s death
                    <lb/>We are told, that when <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName> and his
                    <lb/>family first came up into <persName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</persName>, they
                    <lb/> had possessions in flocks and herds, they
                    <lb/>had been shepherds from their youth, and
                    <lb/>Pharaoh<!--which one?--> therefore, in requital of the ser
                    <lb/>vices of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, established them in the
                    <lb/>land of <placeName corresp="#GOSHEN">Goshen</placeName>, because it was a fruit
                    <lb/>ful land, and fit for cattle.  And there&#x2010;
                    <lb/>fore, during the life of Pharaoh<!--which one?-->, having un
                    <lb/>der the favour of the king and placed
                    <lb/>in an eligible situation, we may sup
                    <lb/>pose that they accumulated very much
                    <lb/>wealth of this sort, and at the death of
                    <lb/>Pharaoh<!--which one?--> were in a most prosperous, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>flourishing condition, till another king
                    <lb/>arose, which knew not <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>.  Now
                    <lb/>if we ask how the very numerous and
                    <lb/>important services of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, could
                    <lb/>be so soon forgotten, we would reply
                    <lb/>that it can be accounted for in no
                    <lb/>other way than by considering the na
                    <lb/>ture of human gratitude,  Some,
                    <lb/>affirm, that the new king was a
                    <lb/>usurper, and feared the proximity of
                    <lb/>the Israelites because they had now
                    <lb/>become a very powerful people, and , ha
                    <lb/>ving experienced many benefits from
                    <lb/>the former monarch, might perhaps
                    <lb/>assist the native Egyptians, in depos&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing him from the throne which he
                    <lb/>But this is a mere, suppositions,  de

                    <lb/>many services of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, we have
                    <lb/>no evidence of the fact, but on the
                    <lb/>contrary have very strong evidence
                    <lb/>against it. for we re assured, in a
                    <lb/>number of ancient historical re&#x2010;
                    <lb/>cords, that a disturbance, a revoluti
                    <lb/>on of this kind had taken place
                    <lb/>before <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> was carried into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> 
                    <lb/>very long before that time indeed,
                    <lb/>and had retained the throne for a con
                    <lb/>siderable period, and also that the sove
                    <lb/>reign who received <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, was in fact
                    <lb/>the first of the native kings, who
                    <lb/>was enabled to reassume the throne of
                    <lb/>which he ancestors had been depriv&#x02BC;d
                    <lb/>and we surely cannot suppose it to

                    <lb/>be likely, that another revolution of the
