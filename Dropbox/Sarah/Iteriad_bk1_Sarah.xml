                    <l>As eagerly waiting the dawn of the day</l>
                    <l>And sleeplessly counting the moments I lay</l>
                    <l>I thought of the joys that my bosom should know</l>
                    <l>Of the rich tides of pleasure unmingled which flow</l>
                    <l>Unmingled with grief and unmingled with gall</l>
                    <l>But draughts of delight rapture banquetings all</l>
                    <l>Impatient I watched as the lingering light</l>
                    <l>Too slowly overpowered the clouds of the night</l>
                    <l>Who clothed in her star sprinkled heaven shrouding vest</l>
                    <l>Which gracefully mantled her eer peaceful breast</l>
                    <l>And while on her brows her dark tresses among</l>
                    <l>Which flowed soft the pale crescent benignantly shone</l>
                    <l>From the earth cheering rays of Aurora she fled</l>
                    <l>In stern winters palaces hiding her head</l>
                    <l>At length the time came when the bill being made</l>

                    <l>Our elegant carriage rolled out of the yard</l>
                    <l>Oh the rapturous vision. <!--period see manuscript.--> But cease this vain rhyme</l>
                    <l>Which not at-all needed wastes paper and time</l>
                    <l>Too lengthened and tiresome Sufficient to say</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVII1v-p1"/>
                    <l>That we entered our carriage and rattled away</l>
                    <l>The road it was hilly and long long it seemed</l>
                    <l>As one hill being past still one more intervened</l>
                    <l>As opposing themselves to our still hoping eyes</l>
                    <l>The neer ending summits successively rise</l>
                    <l>Till raising our hands admiring amaze</l>
                    <l>We silently enthuseastical gaze</l>
                    <l>Oh thrice happy moment for Windermeres sheet</l>
                    <l>In its bright<!--written above with silvan crosed through-->silvan beauty lay stretched at our feet</l>
                    <l>Oh had I a pen that was formed of brass</l>
                    <l>That scenes softened grandeur no words could express</l>
                    <l>Could I grave on a rock that was adamantive</l>
                    <l>Had I the assistance and power of the nine</l>
                    <l>Oh tell me oh what of that scene could I say</l>
                    <l>What words could a partial idea convey</l>
                    <l>Then let me be silent for truly I wein</l>
                    <l>One word of description dishonours the scene</l>
                    <l>With uplifted hands ans with praise never-ending</l>
                    <l>The hill we were slowly most slowly descending</l>
                    <l>And feasting our eyes on the prospect before</l>
                    <l>With lingering steps we were nearing the shore</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp2-3"/>
                    <l>Until we were plunged as we turned to the right</l>
                    <l>In a wood that obscured the scene from our sight</l>
                    <l>Save when some opening space for a moment revealed</l>
                    <l>The scene scarce perceived when again twas concealed</l>
                    <l>I much love to gaze on a ven'rable wood<!--apostrophe instead of coma see masuscript--></l>
                    <l>Which for ages and centuries past may have stood</l>
                    <l>Upon oaks with their mossy trunks gnarled and knotted</l>
                    <l>Which still are majestic decayed though and rotted</l>
                    <l>While their far spreading branches obscuring the day</l> 
                    <l>From the green wooded glades and the birches so grey</l>
                    <l>So fair was the wood on which now we did gaze</l>
                    <l>Admiring the flow'ry<!--see manuscript--> moss-carpeted maze<!--hyphen--></l>
                    <l>And there a small streamlet with verdant banks sung</l>
                    <l>At it laughingly sported the green sward among</l>
                    <l>And now as we gladly emerged from the shade</l>
                    <l>The place of our halting at length we surveyed</l>
                    <l>We drove to the door and the bell it was rung</l>
                    <l>And forth from the carriage impatient we sprung</l>
                    <l>Our apartment was shown to the window we flew</l>
                    <l>But oh what a prospect awaited our view</l> 
                    <l>We saw on the opposite side of the road</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp2-3"/>
                    <l>That four lofty poplars skyscrapingly stood</l>
                    <l>While festooning and twining their foliage among</l>
                    <l>The rig so gracefully garlanding clung</l>
                    <l>They stood on a bank which the crystalline wave</l>
                    <l>Of the woodskirted Windermere lightly did lave</l>
                    <l>So fresh and so cooling as angry it broke</l>
                    <l>On a pier that was formed of rough masses of rock</l>
                    <l>Two barks the wave breasted but moored by a chain</l>
                    <l>In vain that wave bore them they struggled in vain</l>
                    <l>Then wandered the eye as deserting the shore</l>
                    <l>It roved the dark lake and its blue mountains oer</l>
                    <l>Where the huge pikes of Langdale struck awe to the mind</l>
                    <l>With their dark and dread outlines distinctly defined</l>
                    <l>Where the pikes of Scawfell rose so haughty and proud</l>
                    <l>While its battlements lofty looked down on the cloud</l>
                    <l>While its sides with ravines and dark chasms were riven</l>
                    <l>That huge mountain wall<!--one word--> seemed upholding the heaven</l>
                    <l>And now with our appetites sharpened and able</l>
                    <l>We turned to the dinner which smoked on the table</l>
                    <l>Indeed I am wrong I the truth have not told</l>
                    <l>For if I mistake not that dinner was cold</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp4-5"/>
                    <l>Then forth we did spring for we found it so nice</l>
                    <l>That the business of eating was done in a thrice</l>
                    <l>We sprang to the beach there to laugh and to play</l>
                    <l>And to watch the wild waves and the scene to survey</l>
                    <l>First forth we did run to the end of the pier</l>
                    <l>And there the light wave was so limpid and clear</l>
                    <l>You might almost have thought that no wave intervened</l>
                    <l>So pure and so bright and so airy it seemed</l>
                    <l>We gazed when the shoals of the minnows did glide</l>
                    <l>For a casual moment exposing their side</l>
                    <l>Oh then how they flashed they seemed lightings at play</l>
                    <l>Desporting themselves neath the watery way</l>
                    <l>And while for a moment the lustrous waves trembled</l>
                    <l>Flint and steel at a boxing match much they resembled</l>
                    <l>But now we were summoned away by a call</l>
                    <l>In order to visit a fine waterfall</l>
                    <l>At the banks of the lake we no longer delayed</l>
                    <l>But in great expectation we joyful obeyed</l>
                    <l>How teeming with beauty how fair was that road</l> 
                    <l>As it wound round the hill all adorned with wood</l>
                    <l>Here neath the thick moss the wood violets grew</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp4-5"/>
                    <l>And their rich breeze borne fragrance around them they threw</l>
                    <l>And there the red strawberry hung oer the spring</l>
                    <l>And round the old oaks the dark ivy did cling</l>
                    <l>And the thrush and the lark and the robin so mild</l>
                    <l>Were warbling their notes in there wilderness wild</l>
                    <l>We listened the rapturous harmony came</l>
                    <l>And then was repeated again and again</l>
                    <l>While it was the only harmonious sound</l>
                    <l>That broke the still silence that reigned around</l>
                    <l>Save where oer the waters the breezes did play</l>
                    <l>And ruffled the murmuring waves of the bay</l>
                    <l>And now we arrived at the inn Salutation</l>
                    <l>Being quite at a loss for terms of administration</l>
                    <l>Then turned to the right and the hill gan ascending</l>
                    <l>Where the path amid copses of brushwood was bending</l>
                    <l>And wound up a narrow and wooded ravine</l>
                    <l>Which confined with rocks the bright waves of a stream</l>
                    <l>The path it was stony and toilsome the way</l>
                    <l>But still perseoerance shall carry the day</l>
                    <l>While their from the bowels the heart of the rock</l>
                    <l>First forth to the daylight a rivulet broke</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp6-7"/>
                    <l>Then twinkling and dancing all over the road</l>
                    <l>Found its way to the torrent beneath us which it flowed</l>
                    <l>While some mass of rock some convenient stone</l> 
                    <l>By way of a bridge in the streamlet was thrown</l>
                    <l>But it looked so ticklish so very suspicious</l>
                    <l>As if it intended to completely to dish us</l>
                    <l>To alleviate our heat by a ducking and by</l>
                    <l>A draught of the fountain our thirst t' satisfy</l>
                    <l>Though much we admire them yet just at this time</l>
                    <l>Such rock admiration we begged to decline</l>
                    <l>And hoped theg'd excuse that our great veneration</l> 
                    <l>We did not then shew by a humble prostration</l>
                    <l>And now we had climbed where a beetling brow'd rock</l>
                    <l>Hung sheer where the waters in angry foam broke</l>
                    <l>We stopped to the edge- From the brink of the steep</l>
                    <l>Low sunk a wide chasm all dreary and deep</l>
                    <l>The mountain ash hung oer the dark torrents foam</l>
                    <l>And the old stunted oaks frowned all savage and lone</l>
                    <l>High in front rose a cliff oer whose mist covered brow</l>
                    <l>The fierce torrent dashed to the deep gulph below</l>
                    <l>Two streams from the rock where its head overhung</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp6-7"/>
                    <l>In lines of bright silvery foaming they sprung</l>
                    <l>Then rushed gainst a crag where midway it stood</l>
                    <l>And opposed its dark sides to the force of the flood</l>
                    <l>United with back beaten force from it leapt</l>
                    <l>And indignantly down dashing dreadful it swept</l>
                    <l>All wreathed with snow and all chafed with by the rock</l>
                    <l>Twas received in the bason which yawned at its foot</l>
                    <l>Forth dancing so gaily the bright waters flowed</l>
                    <l>While the masses of foam on its surface yet rode</l>
                    <l>Then confused mid the stones all so lightly they danced</l>
                    <l>And leaping and sporting they frothily glanced</l>
                    <l>And their murmurs were sounding full softly and lone</l>
                    <l>As mantling in basons of moss covered stone</l>
                    <l>And now when our sight we had well satisfied</l>
                    <l>And had gazed enough on the fierce boiling tide</l>
                    <l>Tourds Lowood once more we our foot steps did bend</l>
                    <l>And the rough mountain path we began to descend</l>
                    <l>Soon reached we the shore where a scene we descry</l>
                    <l>That baffles description and dazzles the eye</l>
                    <l>The sun eer his glory away should be past</l>
                    <l>On the brows of the mountains was shining his last</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp8-9"/>
                    <l>The bright western clouds their rough outlines unfold</l>
                    <l>Relieving their splendor and graven in gold</l> 
                    <l>Methought little space tween those hills interirend</l> 
                    <l>But nearer more lofty more shaggy they seemed</l> 
                    <l>The clouds oer their summets they calmly did rest</l>
                    <l>And hung on the aethers invisible breast</l>
                    <l>Than the vapours of earth they seemed purer more bright</l>
                    <l>Oh could they be clouds  Twas the necklace of night</l>
                    <l>Then we looked on the lake where the deep crimson ray</l>
                    <l>Shot its light on the waters as bloody they play</l>
                    <l>It seemed as if autumn had given its tinge</l>
                    <l>To the woods which the lakes splendid ripples did fringe</l>
                    <l>And the islands on which that bright rippleing rolled</l>
                    <l>They seemed<!--looked written in pencil--> as if lashed by the pure liquid gold</l>
                    <l>Oh such was the scene which glory reposed</l>
                    <l>But soon by the evening its splendour was closed</l>
                    <l>Ere we reached our home the dark shades of the night</l>
                    <l>Descending had hidden the hills from our sight</l>
                    <l>They died in the mists of the darkness away</l>
                    <l>To be waked into light at the dawn of the day</l>
                    <l>And now being tired we soon hurried to bed</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVIIp8-9"/>
                    <l>And on the soft pillow we rested out head</l>
                    <l>Soon soon we were plunged in forgetfulness sweet</l>
                    <l>And gladly we sunk in th'<!--"e" crossed out and ' added in pencil-->oblivion of sleep</l>
                    <l>Which fluttered with Lethean dews all around</l>
                    <l>And formed his grey wings with a soft lulling sound</l>
                    <l>He poured on our temples those rich dews of rest</l>
                    <l>And folded us round with his thought killing vest</l>
                    <l>And there as he hung on his wings he infused</l>
                    <l>His drawings of pleasure of pleasure confused</l>
                    <l>Thus thus on our pillow we carelessly lay</l>
                    <l>While the hours unperceived floated lightly away</l>
                    <l>To soon as the clouds of the heaven were borne</l>
                    <l>Away into distance at grey of the morn</l>
                    <l>We sprang to the shore  Now so calm was the lake</l>
                    <l>We thought that with pleasure a sail we might take</l>
                    <l>So calling the boatmen leaped into the boat</l>
                    <l>And with pulling and pushing we set her afloat</l>
                    <l>And deserting the pier then for fear of a souse</l>
                    <l>Sat down in the boat and were still as a mouse.</l>
                    <l>But our tongues neverceasing we did exercise</l>
                    <l>And also made very good use of our eyes</l>
                    <l>Of this place and that of the boatman enquiring</l>
                    <l>And the name of this mountain that island desiring</l> 
                    <l>The boatman  Oh he had a fine Roman phiz</l>
                    <l>Strong muscular arms and rough red locks were his</l>
                    <l>To each question we asked his replying upon it</l>
                    <l>Were so short and so pithy so very laconic</l>
                    <l>One I know ( tis a pity that I have forgot em)</l>
                    <l>Can you swim? "Like a stone sir not far to the bottom."</l>
                    <l>The number of th' islands on th' lake do you know?</l>
                    <l>"Awell sir I think tis about so and so "</l>
