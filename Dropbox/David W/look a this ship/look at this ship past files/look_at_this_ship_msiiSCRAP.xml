                    <l>LOOK at that ship</l>
                    <l>Her flying streamer and her mountain <add place="above"><space quantity="31" unit="chars"/>sides</add></l>
                            
                        Her towering mast that seems to reach the sky
                        
                    <l><add place="above"><space quantity="16" unit="chars"/><metamark function="insertion" target="INSERTION1">&#x002A;</metamark></add>Her noble stern her filling sails with drops</l>
                        Of water hanging to her highbuilt sides
                        Glittering like diamonds dangling in the sun
                        That flying streamer shows that she is british
                        And says though mutely I will neer be conquered
                        For I was by the noble british made
                        And Iâ€™ve a british crew those mountain sides
                        Below which boats do look like little pigmys
                        Below which sloops do look like dwarfs below
                        Which mountain sides the brigs do look like men
                        Compared with giants those proclaim her trade
                        And mutely say<s>. I am a warrior--
                            Her towering mast that seems a norway pine
                            Brought from the icy snows of Dorrefield
                            When tis compared with that huge hulk that bears it
                            But put it near the mast of merchantmen
                            And it spreads to an oak of largest size
                            And towers in giant bulk towards the clouds
                            Her stern proclaims her name the Royal George
                            And her huge sails do bear her on her way
                            Her faithless way that played a traitors part
                            And did forsake her in the hour of need
                            And did precipitate her down far down
                            To coral banks to pearls to Neptunes court
                            Those sails that sometimes pleasing zephrs [sic] fill
                            And sometimes Boreas blows with all his force
                            Now at the present time look fair and sweet
                            But who can tell the future. In a day
                            Perhaps those sails are tattered rags shot through
                            With many a ball half dropping off their yards.
                            Then those destructive rows of huge machines
                            Destructive in their making in their use
                            O war what causes thee the curse of man
                            Tis avarice and ambition kindred vices.
                            Tis vice not war that is the curse of man
                            If vice were far all would be happiness.
                            CONCLUSION
                            Thus the whole ship united makes a form
                            Accustomed oft to battle with the storm
                            And urged by boreas on full quick to sweep
                            The Large and waving surface of the deep
                            And urged by men their whizzing balls to throw
                            At other men that they their deaths may know.
