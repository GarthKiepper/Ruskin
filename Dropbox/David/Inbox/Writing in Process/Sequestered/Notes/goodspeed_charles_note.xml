                <p>In his memoir, Yankee Bookseller (1937), Charles Goodspeed dated his Ruskin collecting from his youth in the 1880s, giving two reasons for "the spell of Ruskin": that his books occupied, 
                    if not the highest, at least high rank in modern English literature"; and that the books presented outstanding "examples of book-making" (263, 264).</p>
                <p>As a bookseller, Goodspeed served a steady New England market for Ruskin, which he attributed to the influence of Charles Eliot Norton, 
                    and which he believed himself to have cornered, having "bought more . . . [Ruskin firsts] abroad than any other American dealer" (262). In Lehmann&#x2010;Haupt, <hi rend="italic">Book in America</hi> (1939), 
                        Goodspeed is characterized as a disciple of Ruskin, and moved
                        by many interests shared with the Stone and Kimball generation (254),
                        referring to the small art&#x2010;nouveau publishers of the 1890s, such as
                        Stone &#x0026; Kimball in Chicago and Copeland &#x0026; Day in Boston, which
                        had in common their determination to publish only works of literary quality and
                        to bring out their selections in an attractive and distinctive format (211).</p>
                <p>As a Ruskin collector, Goodspeed was important as representing stateside the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.html">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>, 
                    characterized by a commitment to comprehensiveness in collecting an author's first editions and to preserving firsts in their original condition. In Yankee Bookseller, 
                    he comments on his "mistake" of having 
                    his fledgling Ruskin collection uniformly rebound, a collection that he disposed of and then rebuilt 
                    on "the primary rule that pamphlet issues of all kinds, if intended for sale to collectors, must be preserved in their original form" 
                    (261-62). Goodspeed donated his collection of Ruskin to Wellesley College, 
                    "in consideration of Ruskin's interest in the education of girls and from the fact that both of [his] daughters were graduated" from that institution (265).</p>
                <p>Goodspeed was important also as a Ruskin manuscript collector, playing a highly competitive role in the sales of 1930-32. A key figure for ERM, he took a particular interest in the early manuscripts 
                    available in these sales, drawn to them probably owing to their relation to Ruskin's authobiography. "It is for the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>," 
                    he wrote of his many Ruskin acquisitions, "that I have most regard. 
                    I had bought it when published in periodical form, looking forward to each succeeding number with a keener interest than the modern reader would have for the weekly installment of a story by Agatha Christie 
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Post</hi>. . . . I cannot imagine a temptation sufficent to make me part with Ruskin's portrait of Rose La Touche 
                    and his manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>" (269).</p>
                <p>A narrow explanation of Goodspeed's Ruskin collecting probably does him an injustice, however, as his interests were as wide as Ruskin's himself. He divided his retirement between reading, gardening, 
                    and mineral collecting (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#GOODSPEED">Whitehill, "Charles Eliot Goodspeed"</ref>, 362), accounting for his acquisitions of such manuscripts as 
                    Prosperpina and Deucalion, at a time when few took an interest in these late works. 
                He even bid for Ruskin's mineral collection. . . .</p>
