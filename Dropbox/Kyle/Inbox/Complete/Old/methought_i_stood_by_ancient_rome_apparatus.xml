                        list this poem as one of three &#x201C;fragments&#x201D; composed in <date when="1831">1831</date> and belonging to MS VIII, 
                        along with <ref type="apparatus" target="i_saw_ye_sweep_athwart_the_deep_apparatus.html">&#x201C;I saw ye sweep athwart the deep&#x201D;</ref> and

                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2: 537). 
                        In their separate list of the contents of MS VIII, 
                        the editors do not name this fragment, but it is presumably included within their catch&#x2010;all phrase, &#x201C;and a few fragments&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2: 534).

                <div type="section" xml:id="DATE">
                    <head type="section">Date</head>
                    <p>Approximately between <date notBefore="1831-08" notAfter="1831-09">August and September 1831</date>. 
                        This poem is the first entry appearing sequentially in MS VIII, 
                        followed by <ref type="apparatus" target="i_saw_ye_sweep_athwart_the_deep_apparatus.html">&#x201C;I saw ye sweep athwart the deep&#x201D;</ref>. 
                        Together, the two fragments precede the first cluster of stanzas drafted for 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="athens_apparatus.html">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</ref>, which was begun in about <date when="1831-09">September</date>.
                    </p> 
                    <p>The baseline for dating the entries drafted on the first two pages of MS VIII is established by the draft on p. 3 of a portion of 
                        &#x201C;Iteriad,&#x201D; book 4. In MS VI, this portion of draft is cross&#x2010;referenced as to be found in the &#x201C;new manuscript,&#x201D; which is MS VIII 
                        (see &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;: Date). 
                        That cross reference in MS VI is datable as about <date when="1831-09">September 1831</date>, and thus <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> start on a &#x201C;new manuscript&#x201D; can likewise be attributed to that same period. 
                        It is possible, however, that the entries on the first two pages of MS VIII predate the &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; fragment on p. 3 by a wider margin, 
                        or even that they postdate the &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; entry&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having wrapped the first two pages of entries around the &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; fragment, 
                        with which he initiated his new notebook. While the latter possibility can be neither proven nor discounted by physical or textual evidence, 
                        it is unlikely that much time separated the works drafted in the opening three pages of MS VIII, given <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> reference to the notebook as a &#x201C;new&#x201D; manuscript.

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have drawn his idea for this poem from <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron&#x02BC;s</persName> verse play, <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>. 
                        In the hero&#x02BC;s night meditation on the mountains, Manfred hopes to &#x201C;linger yet with Nature&#x201D; and learn &#x201C;the language of another world.&#x201D; 
                        Recalling when he had &#x201C;stood within the Colosseum&#x02BC;s wall, / &#x02BC;Midst the chief relics of almighty <placeName corresp="#ROME">Rome</placeName>,&#x201D; 
                        Manfred is momentarily able to witness memory and nature joined by the &#x201C;rolling moon&#x201D; casting &#x201C;a wide and tender light, / 
                        Which soften&#x02BC;d down the hoar austerity / Of rugged desolation, and fill&#x02BC;d up, / As &#x02BC;twere, anew, the gaps of centuries&#x201D; 
                        (Byron, Complete Poetical Works, ed. McGann, 4: 97&#x2013;98 [III.iv.3, 7, 10&#x2013;11, 31&#x2013;35]).
