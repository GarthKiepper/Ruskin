                <lb/>After <name type="fictional" corresp="HARRY">harry</name> had learned his lessons
                    <lb/>he went to a poem that he was
                    <lb/>composing for his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>on <date when="1829-01-01">newyears<add place="above"><space quantity="32" unit="chars"/></add>day</date>
                  <lb/>as he always presented his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> with
                    <lb/>a poem at that period. The subject 
                  <lb/>of it was a battle between the

                    <lb/>the poems which he had yet given to his father were printed
                    <lb/>in what Harry called single letter but he was printing this double in this
                    <lb/>manner [diagram] and it was most beautifully 
                  <lb/>done you may be sure. It was irregular measure.

                  <lb/>touched the paper when in came dinner however that hindrance 
                  <lb/>was soon over and <name type="fictional" corresp="HARRY">harry</name> returned to his map. He today nearly finished it, &#x0026;

              </p>
               <p>
                   <lb/>But whenever the world was left ‘To darkness and to me<ref type="gloss" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_glosses.xml#GRAYGLOSS"/> a
                   <lb/>bright thought came into <name type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</name>’s mind  <name type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</name> thought that if he
                    <lb/>could contrive to make a Punches show or rather fantoccini out of
                    <lb/>paper he could exhibit it when he presented his poem and please
                    <lb/>his father a little more so he fell to work to plan one. First he
                    <lb/>settled the size which was to be about five inches long two broad
                    <lb/>and two side ways. The top where the figures were to act was to
                    <lb/>be 2 inches square.

                <lg>
                    <l>This settled <name type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</name> began to think how he should make it</l>
                    <l>Harry first thought what shape the piece of paper must be before</l>
                    <l>it was put together so as to form the show  After he had altered</l>
                    <l>a good deal he found that it must be of this shape <hi rend="doubleletter">[diagram]</hi> with</l> 
                    <l>margins for joining  The piece marked A formed one of the sides,</l>
                    <l>that B the front of the show C was to be bent back and with a</l>
                    <l>small slit in it formed the bottom of the place where the figures</l>
                    <l>were to act  D the top of the show E the other side and F the</l>

                <lg>
                    <l>The figures were first to be drawn with pen and ink upon</l>

                    <l>were pushed up to the top and there danced about. <name type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</name> now being</l>
                    <l> quite satisfied <del type="strikethrough">in the</del> plan fell asleep and slept
                    <l>soundly and in the morning made <name type="fictional" corresp="lucy">lucy</name> learn these constellations</l>
                    <l>and by the time she had finished them tinkle tinkle went the</l>

                    <l>ocurrances which made their appearance at breakfast we</l>
                    <l>shall go to <name type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</name>s poem Alas he was to use his own words in a</l>

                    <l>in that style of printing  with the show it was altogether</l>
                    <l>impossible  So <name type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</name> put off the show till his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>s <date when="1829-05-10"></date>birthday.</l>
