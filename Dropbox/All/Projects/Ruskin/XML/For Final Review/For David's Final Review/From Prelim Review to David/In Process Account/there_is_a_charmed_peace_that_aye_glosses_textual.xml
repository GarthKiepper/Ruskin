                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;</title> to this poem, which is untitled in the MS VIII manuscript. 
                    He failed to signal this editorial intervention by placing the title in square brackets; instead, confusingly, he preceded this poem with another, 
                    which Ruskin did entitle in the MS VIII draft, naming it <ref type="witness" target="schaffhausen_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">"Schaffhausen"</title></ref>, but which Collingwood renames "Entrance to Schaffhausen" 
                    and does signal his intervention by enclosing that title in square brackets.</p>
                    
                    <p>Judging by the content of the poem, it would appear that Collingwood identified its subject correctly in his title. If the poem is represented in Ruskin's

                        it perhaps belongs under the heading <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, between the headings <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">"Schaffhausen"</title> 
                        and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHEFALLOFTHERHINE">"The fall of the Rhine"</title>. It is unclear whether the titles in the list represent section headings or individual poems and essays
                        to be included within sections--or both--but the verse fragment in MS VIII that Ruskin entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">"Schaffhausen"</title> seems 
                        to dramatize a scene similar to that described in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">"There is a charmed peace that aye" ["The Alps from Schaffhausen"]</title>.</p>
