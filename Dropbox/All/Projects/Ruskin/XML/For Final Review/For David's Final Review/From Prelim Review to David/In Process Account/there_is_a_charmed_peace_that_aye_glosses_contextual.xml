                    glimpsed unexpectedly during their walk after evening tea, on their first day in Schaffhausen: &#x201C;Went out to walk, passed one of town gates and ascended some steps 
                    where are public walks. At an opening of the trees which we suddenly came to, we saw for the first time the snowy summits of the Alps, illuminated by the rays of the sun, 
                    which was nearly setting and cast a pink shade on the snowy peaks; it is the grandest and most sublime sight I have ever seen, no picture, no panorama 
                    can give the least idea of these magnificent mountains. The beautiful landscape near us through which the Rhine winds with its richly cultivated fields and vineyards, 
                    formed a fine contrast with the snowy mountains in the distance&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, 36).

                    Rigi is a mountain in the Schwyzer Alps, a range west of the Glarus Alps, which lie most directly south of Schaffhausen. 
                    The ride up to highest peak, the Rigi Kulm, was a popular tourist attraction, which the Ruskins undertook on 25 July 1833 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, 94). 
                    The popularity of the excursion, according to John Murray III, owed "less to its height . . . than to its isolated situation." 
                    "Separated from other mountains," and surrounded by lakes on three sides, "in the midst of some of the most beautiful scenery of Switzerland, which allows an uninterrupted view from it on all sides, 
                    and converts it into a natural observatory," the summit commands "a panorama hardly to be equalled in extent and grandeur among the Alps" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838">Murray, <hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></ref>, 46). 
                    Four decades after his first sighting of the Alps, Ruskin wrote, in letter 34 (October 1873) of Fors Clavigera, 
                    that "I first saw the Bernese Alps from above Schaffhausen" (Ruskin, Works, 27:637). This would have been a different perspective, which pivots the view much farther west, 
                    toward the mountains above Lake Geneva rather than toward the Rigi above Lake Lucerne.</p></note>
