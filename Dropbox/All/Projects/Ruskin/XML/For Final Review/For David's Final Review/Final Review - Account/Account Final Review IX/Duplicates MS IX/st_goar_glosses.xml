                    it is reasonable to assume that he intended to paste a drawing here, but never produced it, or that he produced a drawing, but it has been removed or lost.
                    Most likely, he never produced the drawing at all, since this is the first section of the travelogue to lack even a section heading. The heading "St Goar"

                    In this instance, the inference is very strong, since Ruskin entitled the poem "St Goar" in MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2; and this title was maintained as a subtitle

                    was in keeping with his preference (not consistently followed in all choices of copytext) for published versions 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>,1:266&#x2013;67;

                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref>, the editors followed suit, reproducing the 
                    <title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> version as main copytext as well,

                    is properly placed in square brackets since <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> invented it 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_note.php">System for Title Citation of Works</ref>). 
                    The title is misleading in calling the earlier version a "first sketch." For Ruskin, the poem as fair-copied in MS IX, 
                    which was little altered from its earliest surviving draft in MS IA, was not a "sketch," since he did not anticipate revising the poem to form part of 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="fragments_from_a_metrical_journal_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRFRAGMENTS">"Fragments"</title></ref>, 
                    for publication in <title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                    For Collingwood, use of the term <hi rend="italic">sketch</hi> was implicitly justified by his rationale in printing the earlier version in a note: 
                    "as in the case of [<ref type="witness" target="andernacht_poem_poems_1891.php">"First Sketch of 'Andernach'"</ref>], 
                    it may be interesting to compare the first draft; if for nothing else, to show that the young poet could polish when he chose, and that he would have eliminated the slipshod 
                    grammar and faulty rhymes if he had prepared the rest of his juvenile verses for publication" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891)</ref>,1:282&#x2013;83;

                    Intended to bestow faint praise on the "polished" version, these unsupported generalizations are not in fact applicable to the "sketch" version of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSTGOAR">"St Goar"</title>, which is a carefully considered exercise in the contrasting modes of the sublime and the beautiful. 
                    The <title corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> reprinted this careless commentary by Collingwood without challenge, only adding some bibliographical details 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:359 n. 1). In the

                    <title type="anthology" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> text was used, and in its proper context companioned with

                    which was famous for its echo 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, 24). In 1836, John Murray highlighted such a demonstration: 
                    "At the side of the high road, opposite this colossal cliff [of the Lorelei], is a Grotto occupied by man whose employment it is to awaken, by pistol or bugle, 
                    for the gratification of travellers, the remarkable echo of the Lurlei, which is said to repeat sounds fifteen times"

                    contrast of the Rhine's terrible sublimity with the serene beauty into which it is calmed at St. Goar, Ruskin refers to the turmoil upriver where it bends around 
                    the Lorelei. John Murray explains: "In front of the Lurleiberg is the whirlpool (Wirbel), called the Gewirr, and above it a rapid, called the Bank, 
                    formed by the stream dashing over a number of sunken rocks, encreased by the sudden bend which the river here makes. The passage of the large rafts 
                    which navigate the Rhine over this spot is difficult and dangerous, and men have been washed overboard by the tumultuous waves dashing over the slippery plank. 
                    The perils of this spot, taken in connexion with the mysterious echo, no doubt gave birth to the superstition that the <hi rend="italic">Lurlei</hi> 
                    was haunted by a spirit, a beauteous but wicked water-nymph, who distracted and beguiled the passing boatman with her magical voice, 
                    only to overwhelm and drown him in the waves of the whirlpool"

                    of aesthetic response, Ruskin continues the theme of contrast of sublimity and serenity in the flow of the river, on which his poem about St. Goar turns. 
                    Likewise characterizing St. Goar in terms of beauty and domesticity, <persName corresp="#FMT">Frances Trollope</persName> (<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1863">1779&#x2013;1863</date>)

                    While referring to the deep sea, the drowned men may distantly allude to the legend of the <placeName corresp="#LORELEI">Lorelei</placeName> siren, 
                    which is noticeably absent from Ruskin's poem about St. Goar. Ruskin avoids even naming the <placeName corresp="#LORELEI">Lorelei</placeName> hill, 
                    referring in the poem only to the weatherbeaten "rock" around which the river bends. It is possible that the Ruskins were unacquainted with the legend: 
                    although traceable to the fifteenth century, the story of the siren had been brought to life comparatively recently, in the first three decades of the nineteenth century, 
                    in poetry by Clemens Brentano (1778-1842), Joseph von Eichendorff (1788-1857), and Heinrich Heine (1797-1856); and the popularization of Heine's poem in art song, 
                    particularly the settings by Friedrich Silcher (1789-1860) and by Franz Liszt (1811-86), lay in the later 1830s and 1840s

                    one of that pretty amphibious class of spirits which is called <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi>. Below this rock is the well-known whirlpool, called the Gewirr; 
                    and nothing but the most resolute determination not to listen to her sweet beguiling voice can save the navigators who pass it from being engulphed"
