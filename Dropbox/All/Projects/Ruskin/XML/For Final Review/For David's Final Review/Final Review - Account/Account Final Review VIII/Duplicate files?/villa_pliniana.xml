                <l>I love to hear the names of those</l>
                <l>Who long ago have past away,</l>
                <l>Though now those names be claimed by clay</l>
                <l>And who would stand where they repose</l>
                <l>And look upon their dust, and say,</l>
                <l>That this was Trajan. and below</l>
                <l>This foot of mine, lies cold and low,</l>
                <l>Earth, which compounded long ago</l>
                <l>What held the soul of Cesar.</l>
                <l>How peaceful is the turbulence</l>
                <l>Of spirits, whose high deeds long hence</l>
                <l>Shall still be told as now,</l>
                <l>How strange those mighty powers that hurled</l>
                <l>Wide change and terror oer the world.</l>
                <l>Should pass away we know not how</l>
                <l>That one would wonder how a thing</l>
                <l>So temporary, perishing</l>
                <l>Should dare such deeds, or work such change</l>
                <l>I&#x02BC; the texture of the world.</l>
                <l>There have been many mighty,</l>
                <l>And many more renowned,</l>
                <l>The ignoble and the glorious,</l>
                <l>Are underneath the ground</l>
