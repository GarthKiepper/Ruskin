                <p>Peter, <!-- Does this need a persName? -->my friend, you are going into the service of a nobleman
                    <lb/>as much as a mother can command her child, does
                    <lb/>command you three things, which, if you do, lest
                    <lb/>assured they will enable you to pass through this
                    <lb/>present life with honour. The first is, that above all that
                    <lb/>you love and serve God, without offending Him in any
                    <lb/>way, if it be possible to you. For it is He who gave us, by
                    <lb/>it is He who will save us, and without Him and
                    <lb/>His grace we should not have the power to perform
                    <lb/>single good work in this world. Reccomend yourself
                    <lb/>to Him every morning and evening and He will give you
                    <lb/>aid. The second is, that you be mild and courteous to
                    <lb/>all Gentlemen, casting away pride. Be humble and oblige
                    <lb/>to everybody. Be not a slanderer or a liar. Keep yourself
                    <lb/>temperte in regard to eating &#x0026; drinking. Avoid envy
                    <lb/>it is a mean vice. Be neither a flatter nor a <!-- word unclear -->
                    <lb/>for people of this description do not usually attain to as
                    <lb/>high degree of excellence. Be loyal in word and deed. As
                    <lb/>your promises. Succour poor widows and orphans, and God
                    <lb/>will reward you. The third is, that you be bountiful
                    <lb/>of the goods that God shall give you to the poor and
                <pb facs="MSIX11r"/><!--Ruskin's page numbering.--> 
                    <lb/>needy; for to give for His honours sake never made
                    <lb/>any man poor; and believe me, my child, the alms
                    <lb/>that you shall dispense will greatly prompt both your
                    <lb/>body and soul. Advice of the mother of the <!-- persName? --> Chevalies Bayard

                    <lb/>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy
                    <lb/>father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a
                    <lb/>willing mind, for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and under
                    <lb/>standth all the imaginations of the thoughts, if thou
                    <lb/>seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him,
                    <lb/>He will cast thee off forever. 28

                <p>It is said that French will carry
                    <lb/>you over all Europe, over all civilized
                    <lb/>Europe at least, and that may be, but 
                    <lb/>it will not carry you over Germany. 
                <pb facs="MSIX40v"/><!--Ruskin's page numbering.-->
                    <lb/>You might manage with the Grand Turk, 
                    <lb/>but you will not manage with the Ger
                    <lb/>mans. Wishing to see the interior of 
                    <lb/>Ehrenbreitstein, we got a young German 
                    <lb/>guide, and crossing to a place where two 
                    <lb/>roads met, considered him to be going 
                    <lb/>the wrong way. There was a poser, how 
                    <lb/>could we stop him. &#x201C;Nein, nein,&#x201D; we 
                    <lb/>called after him. &#x201C;Ya,&#x201D; quoth he; &#x201C;Nein.&#x201D; 
                    <lb/>So he went the way we chose.</p>
                <p>After a very hard pull up an abdom
                    <lb/>inably cramp hill, we beheld the top of 
                    <lb/>the flagstaff. &#x201C;There we are all right.&#x201D; No. 
                    <lb/>There was the fortress, certainly, but between 
                    <lb/>us and it, a ravine nearly a hunderd 
                    <lb/>feet deep, walled up the sides so as to form 
                    <lb/>a very unhandsome ditch, and two or three 
                    <lb/>dozen, impudent, enormous, openmouthed 
                    <lb/>guns grinning at us from the battlement. 
                    <lb/>Well, there was nothing for it, so we went 
                    <lb/>back and took the other path.<g type="justification">_</g>

                <p>This time all went right, and we got into 
                    <lb/>the fortress, first however, prudently step
                    <lb/>ping up to a sentinel, to ask permission; 
                    <lb/>and he brought an officer upon us. &#x201C;Do 
                    <lb/>you speak English, sir?&#x201D; (A stare.) &#x201C;Francais,&#x201D; 
                    <lb/>(A vibratory motion of the head, and a 
                    <lb/>&#x201C;Nein.&#x201D;) &#x201C;Deutsch.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ya,&#x201D; and there we 
                    <lb/>stuck. Well, we pulled out our pass
                    <lb/>port, but it was in French, and the offi
                    <lb/>cer could not read it. So he looked up 
                    <lb/>and down, and at us, and we looked up 
                    <lb/>and down, and at him. What was to be 
                    <lb/>done? We bowed and he bowed, and we 
                    <lb/>looked over the battlemets and trotted
                    <lb/>down again, having a very high opinion 
                    <lb/>of the height of German hills, the strength
                    <lb/>of German walls, the size of German can
                    <lb/>non, and the stupidity of all German

                    <l>In the red cloud blazoned.</l>
                    <l>Thus with feast and revelry</l>
                    <l>Oft the huge halls rang with glee,</l>
                    <l>All reckless of the withering woe</l>
                    <l>Reigned in their dungeons dank below,</l>
                    <l>Where, in the lone hours sullen flight,</l>
                    <l>The masked day mingled with the night,</l>
                    <l>Until the captive&#x02BC;s practised eye</l>
                    <l>Could pierce the thick obscurity,</l>
                    <l>Could see his fetters glance, or tell</l>
                    <l>The stones which walled his narrow cell,</l>
                    <l>Till, at the time the warder came,</l>
                    <l>His dusky lamps half smothered flame</l>
                    <l>Flashed on him like that sun whose ray,</l>
                    <l>And all the smile of lightsome day,</l>
                    <l>He has almost forgotten.</l>
