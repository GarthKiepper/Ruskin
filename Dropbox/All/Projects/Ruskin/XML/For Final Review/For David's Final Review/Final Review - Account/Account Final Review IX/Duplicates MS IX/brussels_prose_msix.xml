                <p><placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> is a lovely, a queenlike city, from<lb/>
                    a distance, sweeping up the flanks of its <lb/>
                    hill, battlement over battlement swell&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ing up higher, and higher, and yet higher<lb/>
                    and the massive obscurity of the two hug,<lb/>
                    square cathedral tow&#x02BC;rs booming over the <lb/>
                    whole, and contrasted strangely with the <lb/>
                    delicate sharp spiriness of the steeple of <lb/>
                    the hotel de ville.&#x2014; Paris would look like<lb/>
                    an assemblage of brick hilms<!-- unsure if this is the correct word hilms --> beside it.<lb/>
                    We saw <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> at eleven miles distance<lb/>
                    its towers rising dark and spearlike out<lb/>
                 <pb facs="MSIX23v"/>
                    of the horizon.&#x2014; It was waxing dark as <lb/>
                    entered the city, and the lights began to <lb/>
                    twinkle in the few, the very few shop win&#x2010;<lb/>
                    dows. I love to pass through a city at night, <lb/>
                    the hum of the voices rises so softly out of <lb/>
                    the obscurity, and the figures flit about<lb/>
                    dark and batlike, and the cold starlight<lb/>
                    mingles so strangely withe the red swar&#x2010;<lb/>
                    thy gleam of the lamps, and when you <lb/>
                    look up, the narrow strip of sky is of <lb/>
                    such a dark dark blue, you may see <lb/>
                    it appear to quiver with the starlight<lb/>
                    if you look long, and the white house<lb/>
                    fronts rise so ghasty, so ghostlike against <lb/>
                    it and the windows seem grinning ma&#x2010;<lb/>
                    liciously askance at you. It makes one <lb/>
                    shiver to think of it. Cities are exceed&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ingly picturesque when built upon hills<lb/>
                    but for exploring for circumnavigating ,for<lb/>

                    those hard unyielding provokingly smooth<lb/>
                    flagstones; or to go thundering down,<lb/>
                    his rapidity increasing every instant<lb/>
                    when he is onece in for it, lurching<lb/>
                    tremendously like a ship in a swell, <lb/>
                    jerk, jerk, jerking, &#x2014; Oh facilis des&#x2010;<lb/>

                    The <placeName corresp="#HOTELDEBELLEVUE">hotel de Bellevue</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> ought<lb/>

                    never could discover more belle vue, than<lb/> 
                    a dusty square, some formal houses, &#x0026;<lb/>
                    a few murky park trees.</p>
                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> on Wednesday mor&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ning for <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>, the sun beamed <lb/>
                    sweetly among the long trucnk of the <lb/>
                    aged trees of the forest of Soigny; and<lb/>
                    there damp bark glistened dewily,&#x2014; as<lb/>
                <pb facs="MSIX24v"/>
                    it rose up taller, and taller, branching off<lb/>
                    into the bending boughs, and slender spray<lb/>
                    with the delicate foliage scattered through <lb/>
                    here every leaf defined separately and clear&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ly, as you loooked up to the broad sky there<lb/>
                    in light spready masses partially con&#x2010;<lb/>
                    cealing the long tapery grey trunks which<lb/>
                    which retired back, farter and still far&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ther, yet distinctly grouped, and those<lb/>
                    groups separated by the gleamy stream<lb/>
                    of yellow sunshine, which shone full<lb/>
                    on the sides of the swelling green grassy <lb/>
                    banks, then broken by the intervening<lb/>
                    hollows, then climbing again up the <lb/>
                    dewy moss and white trunks. It was <lb/>
                    exceeding beautiful. I could have fan&#x2010;<lb/>
                    cied the glister of the bright bayonets<lb/>
                    changing, like starlight on a wavy o&#x2010;<lb/>

                    The round hills of green pasture lay unbro&#x2010;
                    ken before me, without a single tree except
                    where far to the right the rich forest coun&#x2010;
                    try commenced again, breaking away in 
                    rounded masses, till lost in the blue of
                    the faint horizon. All is peace now. 
                    Englishmen may feel proud on the field
                    of <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName>, perhaps I did, but there is 
                    something mingled with it. &#x2014; Poor
