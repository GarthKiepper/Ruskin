            <p>How lightly the waves of the broad <placeName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</placeName>
                <lb/>crisfied with the first breath of the mor
                <lb/>ning as we swept over the long bridge
                <lb/>that crosses the river from <placeName corresp="#NAMUR">Namur,</placeName> and
                <lb/>looked back on the rich dome of its small,
                <lb/>but beautiful cathedral, as it began to
                <lb/>smile to the first glance of the joyous
                <lb/>sun that was drinking up the delicate
            <pb facs="MSIX27r"/>
                <lb/>mists which clung to the hills, and rested on
                <lb/>the valley, in which the fair city reposed
                <lb/>so peacefully &#x2014; and then we dashed along
                <lb/>the valley of the <placeName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse.</placeName> I know not, if it
                <lb/>was because this was our first initiation in
                <lb/>to the scenery of continental rivers, but this
                <lb/>part of the <placeName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</placeName> appeared to me infinitely
                <lb/>preferable &#x3008;not in point of sublimity or
                <lb/>beauty, but in that romantic and pi
                <lb/>cturesque fairy beauty which is, in many
                <lb/>cases, superior to either&#x3009;, to any thing which
                <lb/>I ever afterwards saw on the shores of the
                <lb/>far famed <placeName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine.</placeName> There was, to me, a
                <lb/>great sameness throughout the whole of
                <lb/>the course of the latter river, and, for its
                <lb/>fortresses, it is positively too much of a good
                <lb/>thing, a tiresome repetition of ruins, and
                <lb/>ruins too, wich do not altogether agree,
                <lb/>with my idea of what ruins ought to be.
                <lb/>But for the <placeName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse,</placeName> the infinite variety of scene&#x2013;
                <lb/>ry, the impossibility of seeing every successive
            <pb facs="MSIX27v"/>
                <lb/>change as you feel that it ought to be seen &#x2014;, and,
                <lb/>finally, the tantalizing rate at which you dash
                <lb/>away from that which you could feast upon, and
                <lb/>look upon, and dwell upon, for &#x2014; ages I was going
                <lb/>to say, months, I will say, are enough to enchant
                <lb/>you with anything. If you wish to see rock scen
                <lb/>ery in perfection, go to the <placeName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse,</placeName> for never were
                <lb/>rocks more beautifully disposed, more richly and
                <lb/>delicately wooded, or more finely contrasted with.
                <lb/>The amazing richness of the surrounding scenery.
                <lb/>But alas, it was but a forenoon ride, and the eve
                <lb/>saw us quit the magnificent <placeName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse</placeName> with sorrow
                <lb/>for the smoky streets and coal wharfs of <placeName corresp="#LIEGE">Liege,</placeName>
                <lb/>and the round, dumpy, shapeless hills of <placeName corresp="#SPA">Spa.</placeName>
