                <l>The lovely beams of morning mild,</l>
                <l>That oer the Lecco mountains break,</l>
                <l>And red their summits piled,</l>
                <l>That high above their dim shore,</l>
                <l>Their weary winter garments bore,</l>
                <l>The broad boat lay along the tide</l>
                <l>The light waves lapped its sloping side</l>
                <l>And soft perfume of orange trees</l>
