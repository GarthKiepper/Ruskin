                <p>When shall we get up this hill, this intermin<lb/>
                    able hill. Bend after bend we have been ascen<lb/>
                    ding for the last half-hour, every successive<lb/> 
                    turn disclosing a weary length of way, and<lb/>
                    those tiresome windmills at the top seem as far<lb/>
                    from us as ever. Windmills have long been<lb/>
                    celebrated for gesticulation, celebrated with Cer&#x2010;<lb/>
                    vantes all over the world, but never saw I wind&#x2010;<lb/>
                    mills more provokingly alive than at present<lb/>
                    with their long stretchy arms bending to the<lb/>
                    breeze that flew over the hilltop, they seemed<lb/>
                    beckoning us up ironically, while, the slow&#x2010;<lb/>
                    <pb facs="MSIX17v"/>
                    measured step of our booted postillion as<lb/>
                    he tramped it up the hill as much encum&#x2010;<lb/>
                    bered as a cat with walnut shells, told<lb/>
                    us of many a weary moment ere those<lb/>
                    becks should, could, or would be obeyed.<lb/>
                    We are on the summit, a green plateau<lb/>
                    of turf, that looks round on the wide<lb/>
                    plains of France without a single emin&#x2010;<lb/>
                    ence to rival it and few that can obstruct<lb/>
                    its view.&#x2014; Fifteen battle&#x2010;fields are in<lb/>
                    view from that spot, telling a fearful tale<lb/>
                    of the ready ire of nations, yet looking as<lb/>
                    green and peaceful as if they had never<lb/>
                    been watered with blood,&#x2014; They say the<lb/> 
                    cliffs of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> are visible from <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>&#x2014;<lb/>
                    the sea certainly is, so I looked in the<lb/>
                    direction and I did see something&#x2014;. I had<lb/>
                    some lurking suspicions it was a cloud,<lb/>
                    but I chose to believe it was my own <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">Eng&#x2010;
                    land</placeName> and it did quite as well to bid fare&#x2010;
                    well to.&#x2014;.</p>
                <pb facs="MSIX18r"/>
                <p>I love a view like this, for it seems as if you<lb/>
                    were looking over all the wide wide world<lb/>
                    and were ruling it. Throughout all our<lb/>
                    after journey I have seen nothing more<lb/>
                    beautiful or more wonderful of its kind<lb/>
                    than the view from the little, humble, neg&#x2010;<lb/>
                    lected village of&#x2014;. <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>.</p>
