      <p>It is said that French will carry you over all <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>,
                    <br/>over all civilised <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>at least, and that may be,
                    <br/>but it will not carry you over <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>
         <br/>You might manage with the Grand Turk, but
                    <br/>you will not manage with the Germans<span class="g-terminal_comma">,</span><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/ehrenbreitstein_prose_glosses2.php#TERMINALCOMMA" target="_blank"" class="inactive">1</a></span> Wishing
                    <br/>to see the interior of <span class="placeName-EHRENBREITSTEINFORT">Ehrenbreitstein</span>, we got a
                    <br/>young German guide, and coming to a place
                    <br/>where two roads met considered him to be going
                    <br/>the wrong way. Here was a poser, how could we
                    <br/>stop him. Nein, Nein, we called after him. Ya, quoth
                    <br/>he. Nein. So he went the way we chose. After
                    <br/>a<span class="del-scratchout">f</span> very hard pull, up an abominably cramp<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/ehrenbreitstein_glosses.php#EHRENBREITSTEINCRAMPGLOSS" target="_blank"" class="inactive">2</a></span> hill
                    <br/>we behold the top of the flagstaff. Here we are, all
                    <br/>right. There was the fortress certainly, but between
                    <br/>us and it a ravine nearly a hundred feet deep walled
                    <br/>up the sides so as to form a very unhandsome ditch,
                    <br/>and two or three dozen impudent, enormous, open
                    <br/>mouthed guns grinning at us from the battlements.
                    <br/>Well, <span class="del-strikethrough">what</span> there was nothing for it, so we went back
                    <br/>and took the other path.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/ehrenbreitstein_glosses.php#EHRENBREITSTEINPATHGLOSS" target="_blank"" class="inactive">3</a></span> This time all was right and
                    <br/>we got into the fortress, first however prudently
                    <br/>stepping up to asentinel<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/ehrenbreitstein_prose_glosses2.php#ASENTINELGLOSS" target="_blank"" class="inactive">4</a></span> to ask permission, and he
                    <br/>brought an officer upon us. Do you speak English
                    <br/>Sir. A stare. Francais. A vibratory motion of the
                    <br/>head, and A Nein. Deutsch? Ya. and there we stuck.
                    <br/>Well, we pulled out our passport, but it was in
                    <br/>French and the officer couldnt read it So he looks
                    <br/>up, and down, and at <span class="del-strikethrough">him</span> us, and we looked up,
                    <br/>and down and at him What was to be done.
                    <br/>We bowed, and he bowed, and we looked over the
                    <br/>battlements, <span class="del-strikethrough">with</span> and we trotted down again, having

         <br/>a very high idea of the height of German hills, the
                    <br/>strength of German walls, the size of German cannon,
                    <br/>and the stupidity of all German brains.
