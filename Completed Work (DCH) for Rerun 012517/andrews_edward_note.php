      <div class="title">Edward Andrews (1787&#x2013;1841)</div>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> was a popular Dissenting (<span class="orgName-CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalist</span>) clergyman, whose preaching the Ruskins attended starting circa <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, 
                    and who tutored <span class="persName-EA">Ruskin</span> in classical languages starting in <span class="date-1829">1829</span> until circa <span class="date-1833-1834">1833&#x2013;34</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>In a biography of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>₼s daughter, <span class="persName-EAP">Emily</span> (<span class="date-1824-1862">1824&#x2013;62</span>)&#x2014;who married <span class="persName-CKDP">Coventry Patmore</span> (<span class="date-1823-1896">1823&#x2013;96</span>), 
                    and who modeled the archetypal domestic virtues of the Victorian wife and mother for <span class="persName-EAP">Patmore</span>₼s poem, 
                    <span class="title-poem-PATMOREANGEL"><i>The Angel in the House</i></span> (<span class="date-1854-1862">1854&#x2013;62</span>)&#x2014;<span class="persName-IA">Ian Anstruther</span> 
                    presents the <span class="persName-EA">Reverend Andrews</span> as combining evangelical seriousness with a robust appreciation of the arts. 
                    Descended from a learned and sophisticated <span class="geogName-ESSEX">Essex</span> family, he followed his father and grandfather into the Nonconformist clergy, 
                    studying at <span class="orgName-HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Theological College</span>, and then at <span class="orgName-GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</span> (the latter a Scottish connection 
                    that perhaps recommended him to the Ruskins₼ favor) 
                    (, 9, 12). 
                    According to <span class="persName-EPH">Edwin Paxton Hood</span> (<span class="date-1820-1885">1820&#x2010;85</span>), a <span class="orgName-CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</span> minister and a prolific writer about the preaching of his time, 
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> maintained that &#x201C;God . . . should be worshipped with the best of everything . . . best architecture, best painting, 
                    best music, best sculpture, best poetry, and best genius&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HOODVOCATIONPREACHER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hood, <i>Vocation of the Preacher</i></a>, 209).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> entered the <span class="orgName-CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalist</span> <span class="orgName-HOXTONACAD">Hoxton Academy</span> in <span class="date-1808">1808</span>. 
                     Founded in <span class="date-1778">1778</span>, <span class="orgName-HOXTONACAD">Hoxton</span> was at this time a growing and important academy, 
                    accommodating thirty to forty students in residence (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Glen, &#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>&#x201D;</a>, 645). 
                    The principal, a Scottish divine, <span class="persName-RSREV">Robert Simpson</span> (1746&#x2013;1817), did not have the reputation of a scholar, 
                     and candidates were chosen primarily for their &#x201C;good natural abilities,&#x201D; zeal, and commitment to evangelical doctrine 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#NUTTALLTRAININGHOXTON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Nuttall, &#x201C;Training for Hoxton and Highbury&#x201D;</a>, 477;

                     Nonetheless, by the time of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s matriculation, the <span class="orgName-HOXTONACAD">Academy</span> was observing higher standards of learning, 
                    including securing scholarships to <span class="orgName-GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</span>. An <span class="date-1810">1810</span> syllabus shows that available studies included the following subjects, 
                     divided among three tutors: &#x201C;Hebrew and biblical criticism, Jewish antiquities, 
                    evidences of divine revelation, systematic divinity, ecclesiastical history, and its connexion with profane &#x005B;especially Roman&#x005D; history; . . . 
                    English grammar, geography, Latin (including prose composition) and Greek; . . . pneumatology, logic, and belles lettres, 
                    with special regard to pulpit composition and elocution.&#x201D; Students who, like <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, proceeded to <span class="orgName-GLASGOWUNIV">Glasgow University</span> fell under 
                     the supervision of <span class="persName-GEREV">Greville Ewing</span> (1767&#x2013;1841), a <span class="orgName-CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregational</span> minister and a tutor at the <span class="orgName-GLASGOWTHEOACAD">Glasgow Theological Academy</span>
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#THOMPSONHOXTON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Thompson, &#x201C;Hoxton &#x005B;Independent&#x005D; Academy (1791&#x2013;1826) and Highbury College (1826&#x2013;1850)&#x201D;</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>The Ruskins began hearing <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> preach in the parish of <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>, which was a village lying only a few miles south of 
                    <span class="placeName-LONDONBRDG">London Bridge</span>. Like <a href="../notes/camberwell_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</span></a>, a little farther to the south 
                    where the Ruskins lived, <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span> was a rapidly growing suburb but still on the edge of the open country and woods around <span class="placeName-NORWOOD">Norwood</span> and <span class="placeName-DULWICH">Dulwich</span>. 
                    The Andrewses&#x02BC; household resembled the Ruskins&#x02BC; with its growing collection of pictures on the walls, a substantial library on the shelves, and gardens outside, 
                    but it would have been a much busier and noisier place than <a href="../notes/herne_hill_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span></a>. 
                    By the beginning of <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, the manse had seventeen inhabitants, including <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> and his wife, 
                    <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth (n&#x00E9;e Elizabeth Honor Symons)</span>, who was learned and fond of music like her husband; twelve children 
                    (by <span class="date-1831-06">June 1831</span>, two would die in infancy); three servants; and a few penurious clergymen dependent on the Andrews family&#x02BC;s charity. 
                    In addition, a constant flow of visitors was drawn to the house 
                    by the family&#x02BC;s sociability and parish responsibilities 
                    (, 13, 19).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> officiated in his own chapel in <span class="placeName-WALKWORTH">Walworth</span>, <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDSTREETCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</span>, which adjoined his house. 
                    He was at first a candidate for <span class="placeName-building-CAMDENCHAPEL">Camden Chapel</span> in <span class="placeName-WALKWORTH">Camberwell</span>, 
                    where he stirred such excitement that the congregation demanded him for their pastor. Blocked by their trustees, 
                    some members of the congregation broke away and built the <span class="placeName-building-WALWORTHCHAPEL">Walworth Chapel</span> for him, financed to some extent by <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s wealthy father&#x2010;in&#x2010;law 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Cleal, <i>The Story of Congregationalism in Surrey</i></a>, 105; 
                    , 13). 
                    Such generous arrangements were not unheard&#x2010;of among the most popular preachers&#x2014;especially those whose congregations included wealthy members&#x2014;the 
                    largest of such complexes being <span class="placeName-building-SURREYCHAPEL">Surrey Chapel</span>, built to accommodate audiences of 3,000 for the preaching 
                    of <span class="persName-RHREV">Rowland Hill</span> (1744&#x2013;1833) in <span class="placeName-BLACKFRIARS">Blackfriars</span>, London 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Glen, &#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian England&#x201D;</a>, 649; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HILLDNB" target="_blank" class="inactive">Munden, &#x201C;Hill, Rowland (1744&#x2013;1833)&#x201D;</a>). The crowds pressing to hear <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>  
                    soon grew too large for the <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Street Chapel</span>, and <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> decided to finance an expansion with the aid of a new mortgage, which ultimately proved a ruinous 
                    encumberment (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Cleal, <i>The Story of Congregationalism in Surrey</i></a>, 105). 
                    In his glory days, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> attracted crowds larger than could gain seating even in the expanded structure accommodating 1,600 seats 
                    (, 22&#x2013;23).
      </p>
      
      <p>In <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered the chapel as an example of 
                    &#x201C;the Londonian chapel in its perfect type, definable as accurately as a Roman basilica,&#x2014;an oblong, flat&#x2010;ceiled barn, 
                    lighted by windows with semi&#x2010;circular heads, brick&#x2010;arched, filled by small&#x2010;paned glass held by iron bars, like fine threaded halves of cobwebs; galleries propped 
                    on iron pipes, up both side; pews, well shut in, each of them, by partitions of plain deal, and neatly brass&#x2010;latched deal doors, filling the barn floor, 
                    all but its two lateral straw&#x2010;matted passages; pulpit, sublimely isolated, central from sides and clear of altar rails at end; a stout, four&#x2010;legged box 
                    of well&#x2010;grained wainscot, high as the level of front galleries, and decorated with a cushion of crimson velvet, padded six inches thick, with gold tassels at the corners, 
                    which was a great resource to me when I was tired of the sermon, because I liked watching the rich colour of the folds and creases that came in it when the clergyman thumped it.&#x201D; 
                    Like his representation in the autobiography of the toyless austerity of his boyhood, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exaggerated this description, here in order to make the point that his 
                    &#x201C;well&#x2010;formed habit &#x005B;in youth&#x005D; of narrowing myself to happiness within . . . four brick walls&#x201D; supported his &#x201C;acute perception and deep feeling of the beauty of architecture 
                    and scenery abroad&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:132); and see 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HANSONPRAETERITAEVANGELICAL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hanson, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s <i>Praeterita</i> and Landscape in Evangelical Children&#x02BC;s Education&#x201D;</a>, 45&#x2013;52). 
                    While an <span class="date-1824">1824</span> <span class="title-artwork-HASSELLBERESFORDCHAPEL">watercolor of the exterior of Beresford Chapel</span> by <span class="persName-JHARTIST">John Hassell</span> (1767&#x2013;1825), 
                    and a comic sketch of the interior of this &#x201C;dreary Bethal&#x201D; by <span class="persName-ECBJ">Edward Burne&#x2010;Jones</span>, suggest 
                    that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s prose picture captures accurately enough the &#x201C;perfect type&#x201D; of the late&#x2010;Georgian meeting house, 
                    <span class="persName-EPH">Hood</span> remembered that the building&#x02BC;s unusually rich adornments &#x201C;gave you certainly no idea of the dissenting conventicle.&#x201D; 
                    There were &#x201C;stained glass, and the <span class="persName-AARON">Aaronic</span> and <span class="persName-MOSES">Mosaic</span> figures, 
                    the <span class="persName-">Baptist</span> and <span class="persName-STPAUL">St. Paul</span> in carving&#x2014;the rich, loud organ, and the altar&#x2010;piece&#x201D;&#x2014;the 
                    grander fittings perhaps features of the heavily mortgaged expansion, and &#x201C;far beyond what was usual in Nonconformist buildings of that period&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BURNEJONESMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">G. Burne&#x2010;Jones, <i>Memorials of Edward Burne&#x2010;Jones</i></a>, 1:41&#x2013;42;

      </p>
      
      <p>The organ, which members of the Andrews family played, was a particularly vital resource for recitalists contributing musical culture in the locale. 
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> himself was proficient on several instruments, and his accomplishments extended to other arts, as well 
                    (, 18). 
                    He had some success as a sacred dramatist, with titles including <span class="title-drama-ANDREWSVINEYARDNABOTH"><i>The Vineyard of Naboth: A Dramatic Fragment</i></span> 
                    (&#x201C;translated from the original Hebrew(&#x201D;), which was printed in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>. Another title, <span class="title-drama-ANDREWSSAMPSON"><i>Sampson</i></span>, 
                    <span class="persName-EPH">Hood</span> effuses, might have been penned by <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HOODVOCATIONPREACHER" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Vocation of the Preacher</i></a>, 212, 231). 
                    Of <span class="persName-EA">Andrew</span>s&#x02BC;s varied pursuits&#x2014;many of which were self&#x2010;financed, like his chapel&#x2014;a crucial one for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was the role of editor. As proprietor and editor of the 
                    <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> gained the distinction of serving as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first editor and publisher, 
                    by printing versions of the youth&#x02BC;s poem, <a href="../apparatuses/on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwentwater&#x201D;</span></a> 
                    in <span class="date-1829-08">August 1829</span> and <span class="date-1830-02">Februrary 1830</span>. The magazine also published poetry by <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s own children.
      </p>
      
      <p>In preaching, the method recommended by <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s principal at <span class="orgName-HOXTONACAD">Hoxton</span>, <span class="persName-RSIMP">Robert Simpson</span> , was to commit written sermons to memory in order to enjoy more &#x201C;liberty in the pulpit,&#x201D; 
                    and thereby cultivate the &#x201C;new style&#x201D; of sermonizing by <span class="orgName-DISSENTERS">evangelical Dissenters</span> , which pursued passion and drama and at least the impression of extempore inspiration 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GLENLAUNCHINGCLERICALCAREER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Glen, &#x201C;Launching a Clerical Career in Late Georgian England&#x201D;</a>, 648). 
                    This method seems to account for <span class="persName-EPH">Hood</span>&#x02BC;s anecdotes about <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;eccentricities,&#x201D; such as his pausing in the middle of a sermon, confessing that &#x201C;&#x2018;as I came up those 
                    pulpit stairs, I had all the parts of this sermon well written on my mind,&#x2019;&#x201D; but that now he could not remember the third head; and so he commanded the organist to &#x201C;&#x2018;strike up 
                    a symphony&#x2019;&#x201D; while the remainder came back to him. His &#x201C;luxuriant fancy&#x201D; seemed all the more glorious &#x201C;because apparently so unpremeditated&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HOODVOCATIONPREACHER" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Vocation of the Preacher</i></a>, 210&#x2010;13). 
                    The earliest reference to <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s preaching in a Ruskin family letter&#x2014;the &#x201C;best sermon from Dr. Andrews,&#x201D; <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> declared, that she &#x201C;ever heard him preach,&#x201D; 
                    which occurred on <span class="date-1826-05-15">15 May 1826</span>&#x2014;indicates that the elder Ruskins were by that time already dazzled (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 146). 
                    <span class="persName-JR">John</span> grew old enough to pay attention to the sermons in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, shortly before his tenth birthday: &#x201C;I always liked him,&#x201D; he explained to a family friend, 
                    &#x201C;but of late I began to attend to his sermons and write them in a book at home&#x201D; (<a href="../witnesses/letter_to_mrs_monro_msii.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-letter-JRALMONRO1829">Letter to Mrs. Monro</span></a>). 
                    These sermon abstracts, as well as venturing forth into the streets &#x201C;in a hunt after <span class="persName-EA">Dr Andrews</span>&#x201D; in order to put himself in the way of the dashing preacher, 
                    were usually carried out in conspiracy with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s older cousin, 
                    <a href="../notes/richardson_mary_note" target="_blank" class="inactive">Mary Richardson (<span class="date-1815-1849">1815&#x2013;49</span>)</a>

      <p>Within four months of declaring this infatuation to <span class="persName-MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entered 
                    &#x201C;a most important aera of my life . . . the coming of &#x005B;<span class="persName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span> as his&#x005D; . . . tutor for the first time&#x201D;&#x2014;an event that he 
                    dated three weeks prior to his writing this, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> said, which would have been about <span class="date-1829-04-20">20 April 1829</span>) 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200). 
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, who came to <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> to give lessons on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (<a href="../witnesses/letter_to_mrs_monro_msii.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">Letter to Mrs. Monro</a>), 
                    tutored <span class="persName-JR">John</span> in classics, the boy having started learning rudimentary Latin probably in <span class="date-1826-1827">1826 or 1827</span> 
                    under his parents&#x02BC; supervision (see <a href="../apparatuses/latin_exercises_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Latin Exercises</a>). <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> was thus 
                    the first outsider to take over <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s parents₼ role of teaching, causing <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> to retreat to another room in the small <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> household, 
                    although she eventually took an active share in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s Hebrew lessons 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 208, 227, 229 n. 2).
      </p>
      
      <p>Judgments vary about the scope of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>₼s abilities as a linguist and classicist. Two late&#x2010;century reports are at odds, one pronouncing him 
                    &#x201C;one of the first Greek scholars of the day, . . . said to have derived an income of &#x00A3;1,000 a year from teaching the sons of nobility&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CLEALSTORYCONGREGATIONALISM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Cleal, <i>The Story of Congregationalism in Surrey</i></a>, 105), and the other, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own account in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, dismissing the clergman₼s command of 
                    &#x201C;little more of Greek than the letters, and declensions of nouns,&#x201D; although &#x201C;he wrote the letters prettily, 
                    and had an accurate and sensitive ear for rhythm&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:74). 
                    Whatever his qualifications for meeting the boy&#x02BC;s admittedly basic needs, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>₼s most persuasive talent in the youthful <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s estimation was that he was fun. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reported that &#x201C;makes me laugh almost but not quite to use one of his own expressions . . . he is so funny comparing <span class="name--NEPTUNE">Neptune</span>s lifting up 
                    the wrecked ships of <span class="name--AENEAS">eenaes</span> with his trident to my lifting up a potato with a fork or taking a piece of bread out of a bowl of milk with a spoon&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../witnesses/letter_to_mrs_monro_msii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-letter-">Letter to Mrs. Monro</span></a>). He was also gentle and kind with children, servants, and pets: 
                    &#x201C;What a nice face he has,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JR">John</span> decided; &#x201C;I do think to use one of his own expressions he looks best when he frowns next when he laughs and next when he neither frowns nor laughs  Every thing he does is nice&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200). When <span class="persName-JR">John</span> and <span class="persName-MRC">Mary</span> first accosted him in his career 
                    through the lanes of <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>, he was arrested by the curtsy of the Ruskins&#x201D; nurse, <a href="../notes/strachan_ann_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ann Strachan</a>, 
                    and he ended this first interview with a pat for the family dog, <span class="name--GIPSEY">Gipsey</span>. When he preached on 
                    <span class="title-sermon-ANDREWSDUMBCREATION">&#x201C;The Religious and Moral Duty of Man in the Dumb Creation&#x201D;</span>, <span class="placeName-building-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</span> was swamped by members of the 
                    <span class="orgName-SPCA">Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 203, 204 n. 1).
      </p>
      
      <p>In his innocence, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> was unprepared to cope with increasing family and financial troubles. Following her twelfth child, <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span> grew ill. 
                    Long weakened by consumption, she would die in <span class="date-1831-04">April 1831</span>, followed shortly her two youngest infants 
                    (, 19). 
                    In <span class="date-1831-03">March 1831</span>, as these calamities approached <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> paid an unseemly morning visit to 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, to unload &#x201C;a long account of &#x005B;his <span class="persName-EHSA">wife</span>₼s&#x005D; 
                    complaints in the hope,&#x201C; <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> felt certain, &#x201C;that I should say there was no chance of her living long,&#x201D; 
                    for despite such an &#x201C;imprudent&#x201D; confession to a parishioner whom he had known &#x201C;so short a time,&#x201D; 
                    <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> could not prevent himself from &#x201C;enlarg&#x005B;ing&#x005D; much on the torment she had been to him for these last ten years,&#x201D; making him endure &#x201C;caprice, jealousy, 
                    unreasonableness and violence&#x201D; that &#x201C;has marred his respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 242&#x2013;43). <span class="persName-MRC">Margaret</span>₼s account incidentally suggests 
                    that <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span>₼s real offense may have been that she was an intellectual and talented woman who had earned censure 
                    for failing to observe the boundaries that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would later define for &#x201C;queens,&#x201D; 
                    in his <span class="date-1864">1864</span> lecture, <span class="title-essay-JRQUEENS">&#x201C;Of Queens₼ Gardens&#x201D;</span>. 
                    Women₼s education, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would opine, should be &#x201C;nearly, in its course and material of study, the same as a boy₼s; 
                    but quite differently directed,&#x201D; in order to &#x201C;sympathize in her husband₼s pleasures, 
                    and in those of his best friends.&#x201D; <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span> was condemned of lacking sympathetic supportiveness, since her perceived mania, whatever it was, 
                    had damaged her husband₼s &#x201C;respectability and fortune and prevented his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to.&#x201D; 
                    Regardless of whether <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>₼s studies qualified as the male₼s &#x201C;foundational and progressive&#x201D; 
                    labor that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would pronounce deserving of female sympathy, no one evidently thought to ask whether this woman₼s studies might have been even more so 
                    (<span class="title-book-JR"><i>Sesame and Lilies</i></span>, in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 18:128).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, at least, pointed out that <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span> owed his share of blame for his <span class="persName-EHSA">wife</span>₼s condition, 
                    since &#x201C;to any woman with so numerous a family &#x005B;he must&#x005D; have caused much serious and distressing apprehension,&#x201D; 
                    given his &#x201C;flighty . . . habits and manner of conducting his secular affairs, though with the best and kindest intentions.&#x201D; In criticizing his flightiness, 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> perhaps referred to <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>₼s extravagance 
                    in bearing children no less than in cultivating the arts and expensive tastes, the Ruskins having obviously demonstrated greater self&#x2010;government 
                    in childbearing, much less any proneness to &#x201C;unwise indulgence of . . . caprice&#x201C; in women 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 243). 
                    After <span class="persName-EHSA">Elizabeth</span>₼s death in <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, the Andrews family fortunes declined, 
                    and the mortgage was called in on the chapel. <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> continued to tutor <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    apparently to everyone₼s satisfaction, until <span class="date-1833">1833</span> or <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when the youth₼s preparation for university 
                    was taken over by the <a href="../notes/dale_thomas_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Reverend Thomas Dale (<span class="date-1797-1870">1797&#x2013;1870</span>)</a> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200 n. 4, 257, 262, 273, 275, and see 366).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> died in <span class="date-1841">1841</span>, leaving his family destitute, and forcing the two eldest sons to emigrate in search of better fortune 
                    in <span class="placeName-AUSTRALIA">Australia</span>, while the rest of the family 
                    gathered for protection around their eldest sister, <span class="persName-EO">Eliza</span>, who had married well 
                    (, 22&#x2013;23). 
                    A half century later, <span class="persName-EO">Eliza</span>, now well known as a lawyer and social reformer, would open her memories to 
                    <span class="persName-WRN">W. Robertson Nicoll</span>, enabling him to track down <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first publication,
