                    <p>Probably 19 January 1829, but certainly mid-January to March 1829.</p>
                    <p>It is safe to assign this and three other examples of sermon notes in MS II to the first quarter of the year, 
                        when several references to sermon note-taking are made in the family letters. In MS II itself, moreover, 
                        the sermon notes are mixed in with drafts of poetry ("May"; ) for John James’s May 10 birthday.

                    <p>Quoted Ruskin, Works, 1:xxvi n. 1.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is difficult to pin down precisely which sermon notes--the present one, "A Sermon ["beautful allegory"], "A Theme", or 45--correspond to the references in the letters. 
                        After the first reference on January 19, which may or may not correspond to "A Sermon", Ruskin next reports on Saturday, 21 February 1829, 
                        that he was “only at the 1st head of last Sundays sermon”. On the next day, “Doctor Andrews preached such a delightful sermon . . . 
                        Mary and I thought that we remembered a great deal but when we came to write it down we found that we did not remember so much as we thought”. 
                        On 4 March 1829, Margaret refers to Ruskin writing “a novel &#x0026; a Sermon both as far as they have gone very tolerable I assure you” 
                        (RFL, 178, 179, 185; the “novel” refers to "The Monastery").</p>
                    
                    <p>That John and Mary “did not remember much” is reflected in the brevity and fragmentation of all four sermon pieces.</p>

                    <p>In apparently the first reference to noting down sermons he heard in chapel, 
                        Ruskin wrote on 19 January 1829 to his father about “a beautiful Sermon” by Dr. Andrews, 
                        which he and his cousin, Mary Richardson, “are putting . . . down as well as we can for you to look at when you come home” (RFL, 173). 
                        That the sermon abstract that they put down refers to one of fragments in MS II is supported by the draft of a letter to Mrs. Monro, 
                        also copied in MS II, which mentions that “of late I began to attend to [Andrews’s] sermons and write them in a book at home”. 
                        The "book" may refer to this handmade pamphlet.
                        (this letter and the January 19 letter to his father also correspond in mentioning an identical incident of the children meeting Andrews in the street).
