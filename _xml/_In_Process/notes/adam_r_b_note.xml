                <p>Robert Borthwick Adam II of Buffalo, New York, inherited and dramatically expanded the book collection of his uncle, 
                    Robert Borthwick Adam I (1833-1904), a native of Scotland who emigrated to the United States in the 1850s 
                    and established a successful and respected dry goods business in Buffalo, which he expanded to a major department store. 
                    The senior Adam and his wife being childless, they adopted his namesake nephew, then nine, and his sister from Scotland. 
                    For both father and son, the main focus of the book collection was Samuel Johnson and his circle, 
                    but Adam senior collected other writers, including Robert Burns and Ruskin; 
                    and while it was the Johnson collection that earned the Adamses of Buffalo world-wide fame, 
                    Adam II remained committed also to the Burns and Ruskin until about 1923-24

                <p>In the 1920s, Adam II decided to sell his Burns and Ruskin collections, not because of financial distress 
                    following the stock market crash of October 1929--which did prompt him to break up his Johnson collection--but 
                    because he was preparing to devote his collecting energies solely to Johnson and the eighteenth century. 
                    In 1923, he sent the Ruskin collection to the rare book and manuscript dealer, A. S. W. Rosenbach (1876-1952), in New York, 
                    who attempted to interest the collector Henry Huntington (1850-1927). After six years, the collection remained unsold, however, 
                    so in April 1929 Adam retrieved it from the Rosenbach firm and presented it to Yale University Library in memory of his adopted father, 
                    and in support of efforts by his good friend <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php">Chauncey B. Tinker (1876-1963)</ref> 
                    to build the Yale library's rare books and manuscripts department

                <p>
                    April 1929, Adam donated the Ruskin collection to Yale University Library. 
                    The Yale University Library Gazette described the collection as constituting "virtually the whole body of Ruskin's works, 
                    from the earliest to the latest, 
                    just as they were first issued: <hi rend="italic">editiones principes</hi> literally by the score, rare pamphlets, 
                    occasional adddresses, unique copies,--everything that might be needed . . . for the professional scholar 
                    bent upon a thorough and serious study in the works of John Ruskin", 
                    although it was acknowledged that Adam had recently sold off "some of the rarest items" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRENCHADAMCOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#RDFRENCH">French</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#FRENCHADAMCOLLECTION">&#x201C;The R. D. Adam Collection of Ruskin&#x201D;</title></ref>, 1, 6). 
                    The collection was so large that the annual "Report of the Librarian" reflected difficulty getting a grip on the numbers. 
                    First listed as consisting of "over three hundred and seventy volumes by and about Ruskin", elsewhere in the same annual report 
                    the gift is numbered at "some 500 volumes and pamphlets". Six years later, "after an unusual amount of bibliographical study and revision", 
                    the total was set at "464 volumes and 271 pamphlets", although it is unclear if these figures refer solely to the Adam bequest
