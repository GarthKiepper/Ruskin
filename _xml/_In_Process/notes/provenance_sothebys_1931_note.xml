                    ten months following on the first, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>.
                    As described in the title of the 1931 catalogue, the sale represented

                    The <date when="1930">1930</date> sale had been the more consequential overall of the two <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sales of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts,
                    but the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale is significant to ERM for the continuing dispersal of early manuscripts.</p>

                <div type="section">
                    <head type="section">The Contents of the Sale</head>

                    <p>The catalogue for the Ruskin portion of the sale is subdivided into two sections: (1) "Books and Manuscripts
                        (Principally from the Collection of John Ruskin), the Property of the Late <persName corresp="#AS">Joseph Arthur Palliser Severn</persName>, Esq.,
                        removed from <placeName type="building" corresp="#9WARWICKSQ">9, Warwick Square</placeName>, S.W."; and
                        (2) "The Final Portion of the Manuscripts and Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>,
                        removed from his residence, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName>,
                        which is about to be offered for sale". The latter, advertised as the "final portion", was therefore a continuation of the
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>,
                        removed from Brantwood with the consent of Arthur Severn and Ruskin's trustees,
                        as opposed to the sale of items conceived as belonging the Severns, removed the their town residdence, though some items originating in the Brantwood library.
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographial" target="severn_arthur_note.php">Arthur Severn</ref> died in 1931.</p>

                    <p>The Brantwood portion of the sale was further subdivided, like the 1930 sale, between "Autograph Manuscripts of John Ruskin" and "Books"
                        as well as some "Drawings by Kate Greenaway"--the latter, though a small group, deemed deserving of a representative plate in the catalogue,
                        just as the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> had featured prominently in the 1930 sale.</p>

                    <p>Of particular relevance to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> was the first lot in the "Autograph Manuscripts" portion of the sale--lot 27,
                        "Early Poetry and Prose Writings, 1830, etc.". The lot consists of seven items, five of which are comprised within ERM. The lot is described in the

                        which most sellers and buyers typically sought (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> [<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>]</ref>).</p>

                    <p>In 1931, Goodspeed did not immediately re-sell these lots, as he had been able to do in a transaction with Yale following the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><date when="1930">1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sale</ref>.
                        Instead, he issued a catalogue (no. 211, undated) from <orgName corresp="#GOODSPEEDSBOOKSHOP">Goodspeed&#x02BC;s Book Shop</orgName>,
                        <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><hi rend="italic">A Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings, and Manuscripts by John Ruskin; To which is added a description of Ruskin's Celestial Globe and of a few Books from his Library at Brantwood</hi></title>.
                        The catalogue is not just handsomely designed and printed, and generously illustrated with reproductions of drawings, photographs, and manuscripts;
                        it is also a worthy scholarly achievement. Although Goodspeed offered the red&#x2010;buckram&#x2013;bound compilations in their integrity as they had come from Brantwood, without breaking up their somewhat miscellaneous contents,
                        his catalogue lists all the separate items contained in each of the compilations, along with accurate descriptions, as compared with the 1931
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>,
                        which cites a few titles of items at random in order to identify the respective compilations in briefest terms. Goodspeed's descriptions of each item supply the dimensions, number of pages, and medium;
                        and many entries are enhanced by transcriptions of several lines, and contextualized with substantial quotations from Ruskin's works.
                        Whereas the 1930 and 1931 Sotheby's catalogues relied at best on Collingwood's <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title>,
                        ignoring the bibliographical resources in the Library Edition, Goodspeed's catalogue reflects his intimate knowledge of the substance of Ruskin's works
                        as well as their bibliographical treatment in the Library Edition. Perhaps the Boston dealer was able to accomplish this scholarship owing to time on his hands
                        due to slow sales--the Sotheby's Ruskin sales occurred at the beginning of the Great Depression--but Goodspeed exceeded the responsibility of describing his offerings accurately,
                        by additionally making a case for the interest and value of the items.</p>

                    <p>Goodspeed's affection is especially marked for the juvenilia--for example, as reflected in the catalogue's detailed description of "four very early MSs",
                        including the MS IA draft fragments of The Monastery, from which he transcribes 23 lines, contextualized with the relevant passage from Praeterita about reading
                        Scott during boyhood travels to Perth. Goodspeed maintained this enthusiasm in his memoir: from the wide range of acquisitions taking up more than ten pages
                        of description in his catalogue, Goodspeed highlights from the 1931 sale only "two examples of early writings in prose and verse"--another of the "four very early MSs",
                        the MS IA version of <ref type="witness" target="time_blank_verse_msia.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">Time: Blank Verse"</title></ref>,
                        "written when Ruskin was eight years old"; and the <ref type="apparatus" target="essay_on_painting_and_music_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRMUSICANDPAINTING">"Essay on the Relative Dignity of the Studies of Painting and Music"</title></ref>,
                        which, as in the catalogue, he documents at length with Ruskin's ironic remarks in Praeterita about his deployment of such treatises as a means of courtship in boyhood
                        (Yankee Bookseller, 267&#x2013;68). Still later, Goodspeed recommended the "particular interest" of the Monastery manuscript--"with one possible exception,
                        . . . I imagine the earliest example known of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting"--though his enthusiasm was now tempered
                        by sadness mixed with relief at having recovered the manuscript from the fire-damaged ruin of his personal library
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#PROVENANCE"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Provenance</ref>).</p>

                    Three of the early manuscripts that came into <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s possession
                    (MSS <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIVD">IVD</title>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">VI</title>,

                    to the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName>, along with several other items that he had acquired
                    at the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale&#x2010;a quite ambitious purchase by the library.	The final item in Thorp&#x02BC;s description
                    consists of six notebooks, including two containing studies for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRSEVENLAMPS">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</title>.
                    I have not been able to examine these, and they are difficult to trace in the published accounts.
                    I find no such specific listing in <title type="catalog_auction" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, Cat.</title>,
                    unless the six were included in item 40, sixteen &#x201C;Sketch Books&#x201D; (p. 11);
                    however, only eight of the sixteen were known to have remained to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> in <date when="1933">1933</date>,
                    when the dealer offered them along with all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>,
                    and <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> is believed to have acquired this lot in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB 138&#x2013;39).
                    I am also unable to find a listing specifically matching the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> notebooks
                    in the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> catalogs. They might have formed part of lot 122,
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#SOTHEBY1931MISCELLANEOUSNOTEBOOKS">&#x201C;Miscellaneous Note Books&#x201D;</title>,
                    from the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale, of which <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> lists only nine as coming to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>
                    through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> (pp. 67&#x2013;68; and see n. 31, above).
                    The notebooks might also have derived from the <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sale
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings, at which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was represented by
                    <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> (RBB, 138; and see, e.g., <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>,

                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> had offered all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>,
                    who finally agreed to a purchase in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB, 136&#x2013;39). Although the correspondence suggests
                    that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sent all the drawings in his possession for <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>&#x02BC;s approval
                    and that <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> retained the entire lot,
                    in <date when="1944">1944</date> <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was still able to donate fourteen &#x201C;drawings and paintings&#x201D;
                    to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, following the dealer&#x02BC;s <date when="1941">1941</date> fire.

                    A decade after the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> sale, the items remaining from lot 27 that were not sold
                    to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> remained in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s house
                    when it caught fire in <date when="1941-02">February 1941</date> (<persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>, 69).
                    Having rescued many books and manuscripts from the catastrophe, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> began making gifts
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>,
                    starting in <date when="1941-03">March 1941</date> with the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title>.
                    The items remaining from the <date when="1931">1931</date> purchase of juvenilia (MSS<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA"> IA</title>,
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">X</title>) were also fortunately rescued, and these were donated to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>
                    in <date when="1942">1942</date> and <date when="1943">1943</date>. The contents of MSS <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title>
                    and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">X</title> had been disassembled from <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s bindings,
                    many individual items had been charred around the edges, and a few may have been destroyed completely.
                    These acquisition notices in YULG mention only one other manuscript, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRLAWSOFFIESOLE">Laws of Fiesole</title>,
                    of those that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> purchased in <date when="1931">1931</date> and that have not been otherwise accounted for
