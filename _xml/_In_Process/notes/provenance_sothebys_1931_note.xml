                <p>On <date when="1931-05-18">18 May 1931</date>, <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName> held a second sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s literary remains, 
                    ten months following on the first, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>. 
                    As described in the title of the 1931 catalogue, the sale represented 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">The Final Portion of the Manuscripts &#x0026; Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>,

                    On balance, the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale had been the more significant of the two <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sales of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts, 
                    but the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale is important to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> for the continuing dispersal of early manuscripts.</p>
                
                <div type="section" xml:id="CONTENTS">
                    <head type="section">The Contents of the Sale</head>
                    
                    <p>The catalogue for the Ruskin portion of the sale is subdivided into two sections: (1) "Books and Manuscripts 
                        (Principally from the Collection of John Ruskin), the Property of the Late <persName corresp="#AS">Joseph Arthur Palliser Severn</persName>, Esq., 
                        removed from <placeName type="building" corresp="#9WARWICKSQ">9, Warwick Square</placeName>, S.W."; and 
                        (2) "The Final Portion of the Manuscripts and Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>, 
                        removed from his residence, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName>, 
                        which is about to be offered for sale". The latter, advertised as the "final portion", was therefore a continuation of the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>, 
                        removed from Brantwood with the consent of Arthur Severn and Ruskin's trustees, 
                        as opposed to the sale of items conceived as belonging the Severns, removed the their town residence, though some of those items originated in the Brantwood library. 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographial" target="severn_arthur_note.php">Arthur Severn</ref> died in 1931.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Brantwood portion of the sale was further subdivided, like the 1930 sale, between "Autograph Manuscripts of John Ruskin" and "Books" 
                        as well as some "Drawings by Kate Greenaway"--the latter, though a small group compared to the Greenaway lots disposed of in the 1930 sale, 
                        deemed deserving of a representative plate in the catalogue, 
                        just as the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> had featured prominently in the 1930 sale 
                        and was generously illustrated in the catalogue.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of particular relevance to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> was the first lot in the "Autograph Manuscripts" portion of the sale--lot 27, 
                        "Early Poetry and Prose Writings, 1830, etc.". The lot consisted of seven items, five of which are comprised within ERM. The following list compiles the items  
                        with their respective descriptions as found in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName> <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref> (p. 6),

                            The purchase is consistent with Goodspeed's strategy of pursuing materials related especially 
                            to the earlier and later Ruskin, which invited less competition than did materials related to the familiar central core of Ruskin's work,

                            in 1931 apparently a first option to Yale resulted in the sale of only two items 
                            (see <ref type="internal" corresp="#YALE1931"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, the 1931 Acquisitions, and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName></ref>; 
                            and for items that came to Yale later as gifts from Goodspeed, see

                            Accordingly, Goodspeed prepared a catalogue, 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDCAT"><orgName corresp="#GOODSPEEDSBOOKSHOP">Goodspeed&#x02BC;s Book Shop</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><hi rend="italic">A Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings, and Manuscripts by John Ruskin; To which is added a description of Ruskin's Celestial Globe and of a few Books from his Library at Brantwood</hi></title></ref> 
                            (undated, but J. S. Dearden believes it was issued and a copy sent to J. H. Whitehouse "either late in 1931 or early in 1932" 
                            [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINBB"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINBB"><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></title></ref>, 138]). 
                            The catalogue was not only handsomely designed and printed, and generously illustrated with reproductions of drawings, photographs, and manuscripts; 
                            it was also a worthy scholarly achievement. The 1931 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>, 
                            described the lots sketchily and in briefest terms, making no effort to reference Collingwood's 
                            <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title> 
                            in either the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTEREV">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title>'s original or updated version--a 
                            basic scholarly responsibility that the 1930 catalogue had observed. Many of the items in lots 27-30 were miscellanies of manuscripts, assembled and bound in red buckram 
                            in the course of Cook and Wedderburn's labor on the Library Edition. The Sotheby's catalogue described these compilations by citing a few titles of individual manuscripts apparently at random. 
                            In Goodspeed's catalogue, while the he red&#x2010;buckram&#x2013;bound compilations were maintained in their integrity 
                            as they had come from Brantwood, each of the items contained therein are separately and accurately described with their respective titles, 
                            dates of composition, number of pages, medium, and in some cases dimensions. Many of the items'fr descriptions are enhanced, moreover, with sample transcriptions 
                            from a manuscript, or with substantial quotations from Ruskin's works to contextualize an item. While Goodspeed must have found the time for such meticulous care 
                            owing to slow sales--the Sotheby's Ruskin sales fell at the start of the Great Depression--the dealer far exceeded his basic responsibility and lavished his extensive understanding of and affection for Ruskin's work on the catalogue.</p>
                        
                        <p>Goodspeed's affection is especially marked in his descriptions of the juvenilia. For example, the catalogue provides detailed description of "four very early MSs", 
                            including the MS IA draft fragments of The Monastery. The item is illustrated by 23 lines of verse, which Goodspeed would have to have transcribed himself, 
                            and contextualized with the relevant passage in Praeterita describing how Ruskin read Scott during boyhood travels to Perth 
                            (<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title>, no. 79 [p. 18]). 
                            The enthusiasm for these early manuscripts carried over to Goodspeed's memoir: although his wide-ranging acquisitions from the 1931 sale take up more than ten pages 
                            of description in his catalogue, his account of the sale in Yankee Booksellter focuses on only "two examples of early writings in prose and verse"--namely, 
                            two other pieces from the "four very early MSs", the MS IA version of 
                            <ref type="witness" target="time_blank_verse_msia.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTIMEBLANKVERSE">"Time: Blank Verse"</title></ref>, 
                            "written when Ruskin was eight years old"; and the 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="essay_on_painting_and_music_apparatus.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRMUSICANDPAINTING">"Essay on the Relative Dignity of the Studies of Painting and Music"</title></ref>, 
                            described (as in the catalogue) using Ruskin's ironic remarks in Praeterita about his boyhood proclivity for deploying such treatises by way of courtship 
                            (Yankee Bookseller, 267&#x2013;68). (Still later, Goodspeed would again recommend the "particular interest" of the Monastery manuscript--calling it 
                            "with one possible exception, . . . I imagine the earliest example known of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting"--though 
                            in this context, a cover letter to Chauncey Brewster Tinker donating the manuscript to Yale, his enthusiasm was tempered by sadness mixed with relief 
                            over the recovery of this manuscript from the fire-damaged ruin of his personal library.

                            professor of English at Princeton, called the acquisition 
                            "notable for its spread, containing, as it does, examples of Ruskin's work from his boyish compositions 
                            to the last efforts of his literary life when he was laying out projects which illness prevented him from completing". 
                            The range of manuscripts, Thorp explained, would afford Princeton scholars the "opportunity 
                            to study Ruskin's manner of working . . . in all states from rough notes and first drafts to corrected proofs". 
                            By emphasizing the scope and variety af the collection, Thorp challenged the preeminence of "the Morgan and Huntington libraries 
                            and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale [which] are rich in Ruskin materials", since Princeton could also show "reason to be proud 
                            of its share of the Ruskin treasures now in America". As one of Woodrow Wilson's fifty original college "preceptors", 
                            Thorp considered "most enheartening" how "students have moved in and taken over" the special collections department of the library,

                        <p>While these items had lingered unsold in Goodspeed's catalogue for eight years after their purchase, 
                            their significance for Princeton lay in supplying the library with a ready-made substantial and representative collection of Ruskin, 
                            when the library found itself in a position to buy. In 1930, when news broke of the first Sotheby's sale of Ruskin, 
                            Yale University Library had arrived at a fortuitous, if hectic moment, when the library was preparing to move into the nearly completed Sterling Memorial Building--a 
                            Gothic cathedral among American libraries, if not quite a Ruskinian one. Among its carefully purpose-designed facilities was a rare book reading and storage space, appointed to the care 
                            of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Brewster Tinker</persName> (<date notBefore="1876" notAfter="1963">1876&#x2013;1963</date>)</ref>, 
                            professor of English and now also keeper of rare books. Tinker was a tireless advocate for collection building; and thanks to his friendship with the book collector 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php">R. B. Adam II (1863-1940)</ref>, in 1929 Yale had gained the foundation 
                            of a comprehensive collection of published Ruskin, which presented a strong case for extending the Ruskin holdings with manuscript materials. 
                            Princeton University Library had not been so fortunate. Nonetheless, 1930 was a significant year for Princeton to begin organizing future effors, 
                            since in that year the Friends of Princeton University Library was founded, which proved crucial to raising the status 
                            of Princeton's special collections (Axtell, &#x201C;The Making of the Princeton University Library&#x201D;, 513).

                        <p>At the Beinecke Library, a typescript itemized quotation by Goodspeed of items from the 1931 sale 
                            ("Quotation on Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts sold from the material removed from Brantwood at Sotheby's May 1931 and by order of the Executors of the Estate of Arthur Severn") 
                            suggests that he offered his acquisitions to Yale University Library 
                            very soon after receiving them, as he had done in the previous year (see

                            At this time, Yale did acquire a manuscript of Proserpina, which complemented its manuscript materials related to that work that Yale 
                            had acquired from Goodspeed in 1930. The 1931 acquisition is described in the 1931

                            and in Goodspeed's typescript quotation as a "volume containing much of the second vol. with page proof, etc., also a few drawings by Ruskin in the text".

                        <p><persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>'s bibliographical article mentions some holdings by Yale, which cause confusion because seeming to overlap 
                            with Princeton's 1939 acquisitions, but they are distinct. One is "a long sketch on the subject of Infant Baptism, which was later elaborated into the 
                            <hi rend="italic">Essay on Baptism</hi>" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#YALECOLLECTION"><title type="essay" corresp="#YALECOLLECTION">&#x201C;The Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin&#x201D;</title></ref>, 64). 
                            This is a draft of the essay contained in the "Architectural Note Book", 1850-51, acquired from Goodspeed in 1930 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#YALE"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, the <date when="1930">1930</date> Acquisitions, and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName></ref>). 
                            It is distinct from the 39-folio page holograph of the essay, bound in red buckram, which Goodspeed sold to Princeton.</p>
                        
                        <p>A second, more puzzling overlapping pair of acquisitions is Princeton's and Yale's holdings of manuscript and proofs related to 
                            <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTORMCLOUD"><hi rend="italic">The Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth Century</hi></title>. 
                            The Princeton holding clearly corresponds to Goodspeed's catalogue description of the "MS. and proof sheets of the principal part of the work in Ruskin's autograph, 
                            comprising 43 folio pp. (with 3 pp. in the hand of Ruskin's cousin, Mrs. Severn), bound in red cloth" 
                            (<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title>, no. 101 [p. 28]). 
                            It is disconcerting, therefore, that Hogan notes the Yale Storm Cloud bound item of manuscript and proofs as having been 
                            "sold at Sotheby's on May 18, 1931" and brought "to Yale by purchase from Mr. Goodspeed"  
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#YALECOLLECTION"><title type="essay" corresp="#YALECOLLECTION">&#x201C;The Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin&#x201D;</title></ref>, 67 n. 4). 
                            The Beinecke Library does presently own the item to which Hogan was apparently referring, but it is quite different from Princeton's. The Beinecke record describes: 
                            "Wrappers and separate title pages for each lecture bound in; wrapper for 1st lecture bound in before general t.p. 32 cm. Binder's stamp: Bound by Zaehnsdorf. Bound with mounted corrected proof (7 leaves) for pages 48-63, and approximately 14 pages of manuscript additions. 
                            These are inserted after Part I of the printed text". This description corresponds to an item in the "Quotation" from the 1931 sale that Goodspeed provided to Yale: 
                            "'Storm Cloud of 19th Century'. Galleys with corrections. Fourteen pp. in author's ms" The description is also consistent with Hogan's less precise description, 
                            "part of the manuscript and some proof". According to Sara Powell, research librarian at the Beinecke, this item has not heretofore been easily locatable in the Beinecke's catalogue, 
                            because classified as a printed work (BEIN Ruskin +884ta) rather than as a manuscript (email communication to David C. Hanson, 19 November 2019). 
                            What remains baffling are the respective provenances of of the Yale and Princeton holdings. It seems clear that, 
                            since the description of a Storm Cloud item in Goodspeed's "Quotation" for Yale closely corresponds to the current Beinecke description, 
                            and since Goodspeed offered his 1931 Sotheby's acquisitions to Yale eight years before selling to Princeton, 
                            the provenance of the Yale Storm Cloud bound manuscript and proofs can reasonably be traced to the 1931 Sotheby's auction. 
                            The original description in the 1931 <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>, 
                            is unhelpfully vague: "Storm Cloud of the XIX Century. Corrected proofs with long autograph additions, 1884" (lot 29, item V [p. 7]). 
                            The characterization of the manuscript portion as "additions", however, appears to line up with the descriptions in Goodspeed's "Quotation" and in the current Beinecke catalogue. 
                            Unless the Princeton Storm Cloud item also formed part of the original Sotheby's 1931 lot, therefore, its provenance prior to Goodspeed's possession is in doubt. 
                            Yet this tentative conclusion is unsettled by the items' respective bindings. The Yale item is encased in a decorated Zaehnsdorf binding, 
                            whereas the Sotheby's 1931 catalogue description of lot 29 ascribes "folio cloth" bindings to each of its items. The Goodspeed Storm Cloud catalogue item 
                            is likewise described as bound in "red cloth"--the binding that was typically used for the Brantwood manuscripts

                        <p>Further reserarch is pending regarding the whereabouts of the 150 letters from various correspondents to Ruskin that formed part of lot 17, 
                            the 6 letters (1858) to Ruskin's father that formed lot 31, and the artwork that formed lot 25.</p>
                        
                        
                    <!--<p>, along with several other items that he had acquired 
                    at the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale&#x2010;a quite ambitious purchase by the library.	The final item in Thorp&#x02BC;s description 
                    consists of six notebooks, including two containing studies for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRSEVENLAMPS">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</title>. 
                    I have not been able to examine these, and they are difficult to trace in the published accounts. 
                    I find no such specific listing in <title type="catalog_auction" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, Cat.</title>, 
                    unless the six were included in item 40, sixteen &#x201C;Sketch Books&#x201D; (p. 11); 
                    however, only eight of the sixteen were known to have remained to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> in <date when="1933">1933</date>, 
                    when the dealer offered them along with all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>, 
                    and <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> is believed to have acquired this lot in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB 138&#x2013;39). 
                    I am also unable to find a listing specifically matching the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> notebooks 
                    in the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> catalogs. They might have formed part of lot 122, 
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#SOTHEBY1931MISCELLANEOUSNOTEBOOKS">&#x201C;Miscellaneous Note Books&#x201D;</title>, 
                    from the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale, of which <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> lists only nine as coming to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                    through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> (pp. 67&#x2013;68; and see n. 31, above). 
                    The notebooks might also have derived from the <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sale 
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings, at which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was represented by 
                    <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> (RBB, 138; and see, e.g., <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>,

                    <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date>, item 9). Prior to the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> purchase, 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> had offered all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>, 
                    who finally agreed to a purchase in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB, 136&#x2013;39). Although the correspondence suggests 
                    that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sent all the drawings in his possession for <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>&#x02BC;s approval 
                    and that <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> retained the entire lot, 
                    in <date when="1944">1944</date> <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was still able to donate fourteen &#x201C;drawings and paintings&#x201D;
