                    ten months following on the first, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>. 
                    As described in the title of the 1931 catalogue, the sale represented 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">The Final Portion of the Manuscripts &#x0026; Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>,

                    On balance, the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale had been the more significant of the two <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sales of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts, 
                    but the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale is important to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> for the continuing dispersal of early manuscripts.</p>
                
                <div type="section">
                    <head type="section">The Contents of the Sale</head>
                    
                    <p>The catalogue for the Ruskin portion of the sale is subdivided into two sections: (1) "Books and Manuscripts 
                        (Principally from the Collection of John Ruskin), the Property of the Late <persName corresp="#AS">Joseph Arthur Palliser Severn</persName>, Esq., 
                        removed from <placeName type="building" corresp="#9WARWICKSQ">9, Warwick Square</placeName>, S.W."; and 
                        (2) "The Final Portion of the Manuscripts and Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>, 
                        removed from his residence, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName>, 
                        which is about to be offered for sale". The latter, advertised as the "final portion", was therefore a continuation of the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>, 
                        removed from Brantwood with the consent of Arthur Severn and Ruskin's trustees, 
                        as opposed to the sale of items conceived as belonging the Severns, removed the their town residence, though some of those items originated in the Brantwood library. 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographial" target="severn_arthur_note.php">Arthur Severn</ref> died in 1931.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Brantwood portion of the sale was further subdivided, like the 1930 sale, between "Autograph Manuscripts of John Ruskin" and "Books" 
                        as well as some "Drawings by Kate Greenaway"--the latter, though a small group compared to the Greenaway lots disposed of in the 1930 sale, 
                        deemed deserving of a representative plate in the catalogue, 
                        just as the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> had featured prominently in the 1930 sale 
                        and was generously illustrated in the catalogue.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of particular relevance to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> was the first lot in the "Autograph Manuscripts" portion of the sale--lot 27, 
                        "Early Poetry and Prose Writings, 1830, etc.". The lot consisted of seven items, five of which are comprised within ERM. The following list compiles the items  
                        with their respective descriptions as found in the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName> <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref> (p. 6),

                    <p>Lot 27 found a ready buyer in <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Eliot Goodspeed</persName>. He acquired, not just &#x201C;one or two more manuscripts&#x201D; 
                        (Dearden, RBB, 138), but the seven bound volumes of manuscript in lot 27, 
                        as well as the nineteen items making up three substantial lots, 28-29 and 31, dating from the late 1850s through the 1880s. The purchase is consistent with Goodspeed's strategy 
                        of pursuing materials related to the earlier and later Ruskin, which invited less competition than materials surrounding the central core 
                        of Modern Painters, Seven Lamps, and Stones sought by ordinary sellers and buyers 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> [<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>]</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>Goodspeed did not immediately re-sell these lots from the 1931 sale, as he had been able to do in a transaction with Yale following the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><date when="1930">1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sale</ref>. 
                        Instead, he issued a catalogue,

                        (undated, but J. S. Dearden believes it was issued and a copy sent to J. H. Whitehouse "either late in 1931 or early in 1932" [RBB 138]). 
                        The catalogue was not only handsomely designed and printed, and generously illustrated with reproductions of drawings, photographs, and manuscripts; 
                        it was also a worthy scholarly achievement. Although Goodspeed offered the red&#x2010;buckram&#x2013;bound compilations in their integrity as they had come from Brantwood, 
                        without breaking up their somewhat miscellaneous contents, the catalogue lists each of the separate items contained the compilations, 
                        along with accurate descriptions of the items' respective dimensions, number of pages, and medium. By comparison, the 1931 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>, 
                        described the compilations sketchily and in briefest terms, selecting a few titles apparently at random to identify the contents. 
                        And whereas the 1931 Sotheby's catalogue largely failed to describe the bound compilations at least minimally with reference to 
                        Collingwood's <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title> 
                        or to the updated version of the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTEREV">&#x201C;Note&#x201D;</title> in the Library Edition--a 
                        basic responsibility to scholarship that the 1930 catalogue had duly performed--Goodspeed's catalogue 
                        enhances the descriptions of many items with original transcriptions of sample lines of poetry, and contextualizes items using substantial quotations from Ruskin's works. 
                        While it may be granted that the Boston dealer found the time for such meticulous care owing to slow sales--the Sotheby's Ruskin sales 
                        fell at the start of the Great Depression--Goodspeed far exceeded his responsibility to describe his offerings accurately; 
                        the catalogue reflects his extensive understanding and respecte for the collection.</p>
                    
                    <p>Goodspeed's affection is especially marked for the juvenilia. For example, the catalogue provides detailed description of "four very early MSs", 
                        including the MS IA draft fragments of <!-- supply apparatus and title -->The Monastery. The manuscript's description is illustrated by 23 transcribed lines, 
                        and contextualized with the relevant passage in Praeterita describing how Ruskin read Scott during boyhood travels to Perth 
                        (<title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title>, pp. 18&#x2013;22).<!-- CHECK --> 
                        The enthusiasm for these early manuscripts carried over to Goodspeed's memoir: although his wide-ranging acquisitions from the 1931 sale take up more than ten pages 
                        of description in his catalogue, his account of the sale in Yankee Booksellter focuses on only "two examples of early writings in prose and verse"--two 
                        other pieces from the "four very early MSs", namely the MS IA version of

                        described (as in the catalogue) using Ruskin's ironic remarks in Praeterita about his boyhood proclivity for deploying such treatises by way of courtship 
                        (Yankee Bookseller, 267&#x2013;68). Still later, Goodspeed would again recommend the "particular interest" of the Monastery manuscript--"with one possible exception, 
                        . . . I imagine the earliest example known of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting"--though now his enthusiasm was tempered 
                        by sadness mixed with relief at having recovered this manuscript from the fire-damaged ruin of his personal library

                        <p>Describing this collection in 1940, Willard Thorp, professor of English at Princeton, called the acquisition 
                            "notable for its spread, containing, as it does, examples of Ruskin's work from his boyish compositions 
                            to the last efforts of his literary life when he was laying out projects which illness prevented him from completing". 
                            The range of manuscripts, Thorp explained, would afford Princeton scholars the "opportunity 
                            to study Ruskin's manner of working . . . in all states from rough notes and first drafts to corrected proofs". 
                            By emphasizing the scope and variety af the collection, Thorp challenged the preeminence of "the Morgan and Huntington libraries 
                            and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale [which] are rich in Ruskin materials", since Princeton could also show "reason to be proud 
                            of its share of the Ruskin treasures now in America". And as one of Woodrow Wilson's fifty original "preceptors", 
                            what Thorp considered "most enheartening" about the growth in special collections was how "students have moved in and taken over . . . among 
                            the elder scholars", found "hunched over some rare edition and absorbed in creating a thesis or report"

                        <p>The importance of Goodspeed's catalogue of Ruskin manuscripts for Princeton was that, after lingering in the shop for eight years, the offerings could supply 
                            the university with a ready-made substantial and representative collection when the library found itself in a position to buy. 
                            In 1930, when news broke of the first Sotheby's sale of Ruskin, Yale University Library had arrived at a fortuitous, if hectic moment, 
                            when the Library was preparing to move into the nearly completed Sterling Memorial Building--a Gothic cathedral of American libraries, 
                            if not quite a Ruskinian one. Among its carefully purpose-designed facilities was a rare book reading and storage space, appointed to the care 
                            of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Brewster Tinker</persName> (<date notBefore="1876" notAfter="1963">1876&#x2013;1963</date>)</ref>, 
                            professor of English and now also keeper of rare books. Tinker was a tireless advocate for collection building; and thanks to his friendship with the book collector 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php">R. B. Adam II (1863-1940)</ref>, in 1929 Yale had gained the foundation 
                            of a comprehensive collection of published Ruskin, which presented a strong case for extending the Ruskin holdings with manuscript materials. 
                            Princeton University Library had not been so fortunate. Nonetheless, 1930 was a significant year for Princeton to begin organizing future effors, 
                            since in that year the Friends of Princeton University Library was founded, which proved crucial to raising the status 
                            of Princeton's special collections (Axtell, &#x201C;The Making of the Princeton University Library&#x201D;, 513).</p>
                        
                        <p>The chachet of acquiring a Ruskin collection during a period of library expansion was probably not significant for Princeton since the pressing architectural 
                            problems were functional rather than aesthetic. Princeton already possessed a Ruskinian-influenced library building, the Chancellor Green Library (1872), 
                            designed in the Venetian polychromatic Gothic style by William Appleton Potter (1842-1909). 
                            The building's octagonal plan--centered on a panopticon-like reference desk, which was encircled by radiating shelves and reading desks--was 
                            responsive to librarians' thinking of the time, that services should be "tri-partitioned" into staff services, secure stacks, and patron reading areas. 
                            Rapidly outgrown, the Chancellor Green was extended in 1897, by being joined to the new Pyne Librry--a more practical rectangular building, 
                            designed by Potter in "collegiate" Tudor Gothic 
                            (Wodehouse, &#x201C;William Appleton Potter&#x201D;, 176, 184, 192; 
                            Kaser, <hi rend="italic">Evolution of the American Academic Library Building</hi>, 32-33).
                            Even the combined buildings soon reached capacity, however, despite what was regarded as an embarrassingly modest pace of growth, compared 
                            to the mammoth collections held by Yale and Harvard. Moreover, the buildings were not designed to accommodate the flexibility and increased usage demanded 
                            by the pedagogical innovations that Wilson introduced in 1905--the preceptorial method of instruction--and that were further developed in 1923 
                            as the "Four-Course" plan, which stressed independent and wide-ranging reading. While the Friends organization was, at heart, devoted more 
                            to amassing a competitive rare books and manuscript collection for the library than to addressing brick-and-mortar issues, 
                            they nonetheless gravitated to a natural alliance with the bookish humanities and social sciences faculty, since, as Axtell remarks, 
                            they expected their donations to be well cared for and used in an up-to-date facility, as opposed to the dank storage and paltry exhibition space allowed by the Pyne 
                            (Axtell, &#x201C;The Making of the Princeton University Library&#x201D;, 507-10, 521-23).</p>
                        
                        <p>That alliance is epitomized by the funding for the Ruskin purchase, which was secured "almost entirely by means of contributions" 
                            from the Friends, faculty in the Department of English and Department of Art, and alumni. Among the English Department faculty 
                            were Professor Willard Thorp (a chief organizer of the effort) and Professor Charles Grosvenor Osgood (1871-1964)--the

                    <p>At the Beinecke Library, a typescript itemized quotation by Goodspeed of items from the 1931 sale suggests that he offered his acquisitions to Yale University Library 
                        very soon after receiving them, as he had done in the previous year (see 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: The Buyers</ref>). 
                        In 1931, complementing the acquisition of Proserpina manuscript in 1930, Yale purchased another bound manuscript of the work, described in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1931"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi></title></ref>, 
                        as "107 pp. with corrected proof, a few pen-and-ink drawings" (p. 7 ["Prose Writings, 1881-85", items II]), and in Goodspeed's typescript as a "volume containing much of the second vol. with 
                        page proof, etc., also a few drawings by Ruskin in the text". This purchase in 1931 is confirmed both in the current Beinecke Library

                        by <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Charles Beecher Hogan</persName> (p. 67 n. 4). Logically, this latter manuscript of Proserpina is not listed in

                    , along with several other items that he had acquired 
                    at the <date when="1931">1931</date> sale&#x2010;a quite ambitious purchase by the library.	The final item in Thorp&#x02BC;s description 
                    consists of six notebooks, including two containing studies for <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRSEVENLAMPS">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</title>. 
                    I have not been able to examine these, and they are difficult to trace in the published accounts. 
                    I find no such specific listing in <title type="catalog_auction" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, Cat.</title>, 
                    unless the six were included in item 40, sixteen &#x201C;Sketch Books&#x201D; (p. 11); 
                    however, only eight of the sixteen were known to have remained to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> in <date when="1933">1933</date>, 
                    when the dealer offered them along with all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>, 
                    and <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> is believed to have acquired this lot in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB 138&#x2013;39). 
                    I am also unable to find a listing specifically matching the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> notebooks 
                    in the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> catalogs. They might have formed part of lot 122, 
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#SOTHEBY1931MISCELLANEOUSNOTEBOOKS">&#x201C;Miscellaneous Note Books&#x201D;</title>, 
                    from the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale, of which <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> lists only nine as coming to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                    through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> (pp. 67&#x2013;68; and see n. 31, above). 
                    The notebooks might also have derived from the <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> sale 
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings, at which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was represented by 
                    <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> (RBB, 138; and see, e.g., <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName>,

                    <date when="1931-05-20">20 May 1931</date>, item 9). Prior to the <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> purchase, 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> had offered all his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings to <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>, 
                    who finally agreed to a purchase in <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB, 136&#x2013;39). Although the correspondence suggests 
                    that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> sent all the drawings in his possession for <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>&#x02BC;s approval 
                    and that <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> retained the entire lot, 
                    in <date when="1944">1944</date> <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was still able to donate fourteen &#x201C;drawings and paintings&#x201D; 
                    to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, following the dealer&#x02BC;s <date when="1941">1941</date> fire. 
                    
                    A decade after the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> sale, the items remaining from lot 27 that were not sold 
                    to <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton</orgName> remained in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s house 
                    when it caught fire in <date when="1941-02">February 1941</date> (<persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>, 69). 
                    Having rescued many books and manuscripts from the catastrophe, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> began making gifts 
                    of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, 
                    starting in <date when="1941-03">March 1941</date> with the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title>. 
                    The items remaining from the <date when="1931">1931</date> purchase of juvenilia (MSS<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA"> IA</title>, 
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">X</title>) were also fortunately rescued, and these were donated to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                    in <date when="1942">1942</date> and <date when="1943">1943</date>. The contents of MSS <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title> 
                    and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSX">X</title> had been disassembled from <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s bindings, 
                    many individual items had been charred around the edges, and a few may have been destroyed completely.	
                    These acquisition notices in YULG mention only one other manuscript, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRLAWSOFFIESOLE">Laws of Fiesole</title>, 
                    of those that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> purchased in <date when="1931">1931</date> and that have not been otherwise accounted for 
                    in the preceding discussion (see also part 2, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, 
                    &#x201C;Description&#x201D;). . . . [information to come] The reconstruction of the contents of MSS <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title>
