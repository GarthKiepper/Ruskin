                <head type="title">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth</head>
                <p>The aim of this note is not to attempt an exhaustive listing of books that Ruskin read or consulted in his youth. 
                    Throughout ERM, information about the influences of Ruskin's reading is available 
                    in the apparatuses and glosses of works that contain specific allusions to and borrowings from publications to which he was exposed. 
                    Moreover, especially influential authors and published sources are additionally discussed in notes of their own. 
                    This information may be searched by keyword, and relevant biographical and contextual notes are also linked below. 
                    The purpose of the present note, rather, is to centralize various information nowhere else referenced in the archive, 
                    particularly information about material features and marginalia of books that survive 
                    allegedly from the Ruskin family library (provenance is not clear in all cases). Such features are too detailed to have been included 
                    in the preeminent enumerative bibliographies, Van Akin Burd's transcriptions of book purchases noted in 
                    John James Ruskin's Account Book (RF MS 28, 1827&#x2013;45), collected by year in notes to Ruskin Family Letters; 
                    and James S. Dearden's The Library of John Ruskin. Those sources remain a starting point for investigation of Ruskin's reading.</p>

                    <p>The simple documented presence of a given title--or for that matter, its absence--can of course tell us only so much 
                        about a book's use by members of the family. For example, some of John James's purchases of books designed for youths 
                        may have been meant less for Ruskin than for his cousin, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (1815&#x2013;49)</ref>, 
                        who lived with the Ruskin family from 1828 to her marriage in 1848. 
                        About the family library, Dearden comments: "the books owned by all three Ruskins 
                        must be considered to be part of 'Ruskin's Library' because he ultimately inherited his parents' possessions, 
                        as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes". That availability for use, if not inheritance, 
                        may or may not have included Mary Richardson's books. About the known scope of Ruskin's books, 
                        Dearden cautiously concludes: "although Ruskin's lifetime's library was much greater than it was at any <hi rend="italic">one</hi> time, 
                        we do not know its total extent" (Library of John Ruskin, xv, xxiv). In ERM, that scope is extended 
                        in apparatuses and glosses, which occasionally are able to point to definite influence of publications that otherwise left no material trace in the records of the family library.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dearden's view is well taken, too, that in adulthood Ruskin "was essentially . . . a book-buyer rather than a book borrower or library user" 
                        (Library of John Ruskin, xix). Ruskin seems to have inherited this habit from his father, 
                        who was generous with books for his son's education and entertainment. Borrowing cannot be dismissed, however, as a source for family reading. 
                        On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping resources for English readers along the way, 
                        such as when Mary Richardson cheered up John, who had taken ill while touring Switzerland in 1833, 
                        by finding him "some English books from a library" along with "2 or 3 volumes of Gagliani's Magazine" 
                        (i.e., probably one of the periodicals issued by Librairie Galignani, 
                        the Paris-based English-language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library, which published a monthly, 
                        the Repertory of English Literature [begun 1808], and a daily, Gaglinani's Messenger [begun 1814])
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="transcript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 106). 
                        At home, Margaret Ruskin appears to refer to borrowing when, for example, she writes to Jahn James about the novel, 
                        The Fool of Quality (1766-72) by Henry Brooke (1703-83), of which she "got the first volume merely to read the History of the three little fishes 
                        to John", since she otherwise "did not like" the book (Margaret to John James Ruskin, 15 May 1826, 
                        RFL 145). The episode may illustrate Margaret's caution about allowing books in the house that she considered harmful. 
                        (In this case, "the Almighty open[ed] the understanding" in her renewed encounter with the novel, 
                        committing her to "read it together" with John James. Perhaps she obtained a copy in John Wesley's abridgement.)</p>
                    
                    <p>A caveat should also be applied to Ruskin's own account of his boyhood reading in Praeterita. 
                        The authors and titles he names are not untrue to his early reading, but the account has charmed readers 
                        into fixating on a short list of titles that is potentially misleading. The selectiveness 
                        of the list--for example, contrasting the enforced Sunday reading of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe 
                        with "reading of my own election" on weekdays of Walter Scott's novels and Homer (Alexander Pope's translation of the Iliad)--is 
                        calculated to establish the autobiography's gently comic, ironic tone, but also instills the impression 
                        that Ruskin's study of these books was both simultaneous and compartmentalized. The impression obscures 
                        the graduated program of reading that Ruskin's parents set for his education as well as the sometimes eccentric and resistant approach 
                        that Ruskin took to that program. While there must always have been compartmentalization yet overlap of kinds of study--routine 
                        times of day devoted respectively to Bible reading, lessons, and leisure reading--the early manuscripts reflect 
                        the tiered plan for instruction that educationists had popularized since the late eighteenth century. 
                        Ruskin's schooling in the secular ethical and scientific dialogues of Letitia Barbauld, the Edgeworths, Thomas Day, and Jeremiah Joyce 
                        was largely confined to early years, ca. 1826-29, while serious religious study succeeded that stage, starting in 1829. 
                        At the same time, the boy tended to defy the program, skipping ahead to dialogues meant for older children. 
                        Some of his imaginative reading, meanwhile, such as Walter Scott's The Monastery, wrought an effect on his religious life as profound as the sermons he started to study at the same time.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dearden helpfully annotates his entries with provenance and other information, 
                        and Burd connects John James's brief notations of authors/titles and amounts spent on book purchases 
                        with editions available at the time from publishers at those prices. Burd's transcriptions should nonetheless 
                        be compared against the manuscript of the Account Book, since John James's entries are sometimes ambiguous, 
                        warranting closer scrutiny. For convenience of reference, there follow the locations of Burd's transcriptions of book lists 
                        in Ruskin Family Letters, along with the corresponding pages of John James's accounting of "Sundries", 
                        which is how he caregorized books along with other non-perishable household items, subdivided by month of purchase.</p>
                    
                    <p>One year of sundry book purchases, those for 1830, was omitted by Burd in Ruskin Family Letters, 
                        presumably because no letters from that year are extant, thus giving no occasion for annotation. 
                        Dearden has incorporated some of this information into the alphabetized entries in The Library of John Ruskin. 
                        Because chronological lists are particularly salient to ERM, however, John James's 1830 book list is supplied 
                        in its integrity, cross-referenced with entries in Dearden. 
                        Names are transcribed that may or may not refer to authors (John James often listed vendors by name, 
                        in place of the wares they supplied). These identifications remain in process.</p>

                    signature (where does she say so? not in Backgrounds where she assigns earliest
                    signature to Frank&#x2014;maybe she thought better of it <!--Correction needed here?-->).</p>

                <p> A copy owned by Ruskin with a Brantwood bookplate was acquired by Sharp
                    (Viljoen, Ruskin&#x02BC; Backgrounds, 7). Sharp gave his collection to Helen Gill
                    Viljoen, who in turn, in dividing her collection between libraries, gave the
                    Ruskin books in her possession to the Beinecke Library, Yale
                    University, New Haven, Conn., where this copy of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;
                    remains.</p>
                <p>The copy is a first (1825) edition <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>It is unclear whether this copy is the one that Ruskin used in childhood. The
                    binding is tight and the pages clean, as compared with Ruskin&#x02BC;s
                    boyhood copy of Edgeworth, Frank, which <!--Entry needed here.--> and which contains marginalia in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s boyhood as well as mature hands. All <!--Correction needed here?--> the marginalia in
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D; is in Ruskin&#x02BC;s mature
                    hand; however, a crude geometrical drawing on the back endpaper of volume 4 may
                    date from boyhood <!--Correction needed here?-->.</p>
                <p>Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> (Ruskin&#x02BC;s copy)</p>
                <p>A copy owned by Ruskin with a Brantwood bookplate was acquired by Sharp (Viljoen,
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s Backgrounds, 6). Sharp gave his collection to Helen Gill Viljoen, who in
                    turn, in dividing her collection between libraries, gave the Ruskin
                    books in her possession to the Beinecke Library, Yale University, New Haven,
                    Conn., where this copy of <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> remains.</p>
                <p>The copy is a first (1822) edition in three volumes <!--Entry needed here.-->.</p>
                <p>The volumes, which have had heavy use <!--Entry needed here.-->, contain marginalia in the hand
                    of one of his parents and in Ruskin&#x02BC;s&#x2014;both his boyhood
                    and mature hands. The first volume has an inscription, &#x201C;John
                    Ruskin,&#x201D; on the first flyleaf (recto), which Viljoen identifies as
                    the hand of John James Ruskin; then, on a blank page which follows [i.e., the
                    second flyleaf, recto], [is] Ruskin&#x02BC;s earliest known signature <!--Correction needed here?-->, a
                    pencilled one Ruskin apparently copied, in a most childish scrawl, from the name
                    as written in ink by his Father (ibid.). <!--Entry needed here.-->
                    Whether this is indeed Ruskin earliest extant signature cannot be determined,
                    but the cursive script, which Ruskin did not generally adopt before <!--Entry needed here.-->, is
                    indeed very labored.</p>
                <p>The endpapers (<!--Entry needed here.-->) of volume 1 also contain Frank drawing, untitled no. 1,
                    and Frank drawing, untitled no. 2.</p>
