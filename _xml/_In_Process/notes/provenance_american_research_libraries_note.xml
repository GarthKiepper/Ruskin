                    The primary buyer at these sales for the American market was the Boston rare book dealer, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>)</ref>, 
                    who sold in turn to Yale University Library and to Princeton University Library. 
                    Another participant stateside in the 1930 sale was the Yale English Department professor and Yale Library keeper of rare books, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Brewster Tinker</persName> (<date notBefore="1876" notAfter="1963">1876&#x2013;1963</date>)</ref>. 
                    although further research is required to clarify Tinker's role beyond serving as Yale's agent for purchasing from Goodspeed. 
                    At Princeton, a key figure in securing several of Goodspeed's acquisitions from the 1931 Sotheby's sale for the university library was 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="thorp_willard_note.php"><persName corresp="#WT">Willard Thorp</persName> (<date notBefore="1111" notAfter="1111">0000&#x2013;0000</date>)</ref>.</p>
                
                <p>At these institutions, collecting Ruskin in general, and the early manuscripts in particular, grew out of trends in private collecting, 
                    resulting in donations that benefited the libraries. At Yale between the World Wars, collecting of Ruskin and of much else was driven by Tinker, 
                    who advocated practical use of his own and others' collections by graduate students. Tinker persuaded his friend and fellow collector 
                    R. B. Adam to allow graduate students access to his book and manuscript collection, which was devoted primarily to Samuel Johnson and the eighteeenth century, 
                    but which also included hundreds of Ruskin items. Thanks to this friendship, Adam donated his Ruskin collection to Yale University Library in 1929, 
                    just one year previous to the opportunity for Yale to augment that collection of printed Ruskin with a wide range manuscripts 
                    acquired through Goodspeed from the 1930 Sotheby's sale. A decade later at Princeton, Willard Thorp, a scholar-teacher in the English Department, 
                    likewise advocated for developing the university library's rare book and manuscript collection to support student research. 
                    These activities derived additional impetus from Ivy League competition, Princeton envying Yale's much larger 
                    library holdings, and both eyeing Harvard's--at the time, the largest research collection among American universities. 
                    Goodspeed donated his print collection of Ruskin to Wellesley College owing to personal connections with that institution.</p>
                
                <p>The generation of American collectors represented by Goodspeed, Tinker, and Adam was guided in their Ruskin collecting by the phenomenon of 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.html">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>, 
                    which aspired to comprehensive collections of every printed item in its original condition by the author of choice. Manuscript collecting mirrored 
                    this ambition for comprehensiveness, from juvenilia to last words, and the opportunity to achieve that scope became possible through the two Sotheby's sales. 
                    The bibliographical details of American institutions' acquisitions at those sales are described in 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref> and the

                    The present note discusses factors that may have influenced Ruskin collecting at particular institutions.</p>

                        <p>It would not have been lost on <persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Tinker</persName> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> materials formed an appropriate acquisition at the time when the <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale Library</orgName> 
                            was moving to the newly completed <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Building</placeName>. Architecturally, the structure wraps a Gothic cathedral&#x2010; and cloister&#x2010;like shell, 
                            which houses the reading and circulation spaces, around a setback skyscraper tower, containing the stacks and technical operations. 
                            In context of this project, a research collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was perhaps considered appropriate, but not vital, 
                            to discussion about architectural style at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>The time was past when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas were realized directly in designs for Yale's campus buildings. 
                            Ruskinian Gothic flourished from <date when="1864">1864</date>, with P. B. Wight&#x02bc;s (<date notBefore="1838" notAfter="1925">1838&#x2013;1925</date>) design for the Street Fine Arts Building, 
                            through the mid&#x2010;1880s, with Russell Sturgis&#x02bc;s (<date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1909">1836&#x2013;1909</date>) work on Battell Chapel and other buildings. 
                            These men were <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> enthusiasts, and their understanding of his architectural and social ideas found supporters among the faculty 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LYNNBUILDINGYALE"><persName corresp="#CLYNN">Lynn</persName>, &#x201c;Building Yale and Razing It from the Civil War to the Great Depression&#x201d;</ref>, 110&#x2013;18). 
                            But by the <date notBefore="1920" notAfter="1939">1920s&#x2013;30s</date>, Victorian thinking about architecture was being displaced by Bauhaus; 
                            and while Gothic Revival persisted in Yale's campus development, just as "collegiate Gothic" thrived on American campuses elsewhere, 
                            which teachers like Tinker and their students must have connected with their readings in Ruskin, it is questionable 
                            whether Ruskin's ideas retained the force of an ideology for architects of American universities. 
                            According to <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Paul Goldberger</persName>, the designer of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library</placeName>, 
                            James Gamble Rogers (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1947">1867&#x2013;1947</date>), was not prone to defend either its neo&#x2010;Gothic design or its skyscraper functionality on ideological grounds. 
                            Rogers&#x02bc;s buildings, Goldberger believes, did not aspire to &#x201c;the same kind of moral authority 
                            that <persName corresp="#AWNP">[Augustus Welby] Pugin&#x02bc;s</persName> or <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Gothic possessed in the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date>&#x201d; 
                            and that Wight&#x02bc;s and Sturgis&#x02bc;s campus buildings articulated for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> a half&#x2010;century earlier; Rogers sought, rather, 
                            &#x201c;to provide pleasure for the eye along with a casual, undemanding association with the past&#x201d; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOLDBERGERROGERS">&#x201c;James Gamble Rogers and the Shaping of Yale in the Twentieth Century&#x201d;</ref>, 272).</p>
                        
                        <p>At the same time, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling building</placeName> epitomized what one historian has characterized as the &#x201c;golden age&#x201d; of the American university library (<date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1940">1890&#x2013;1940</date>), 
                            when free&#x2010;standing, architecturally imposing library buildings were erected at the geographical and intellectual heart of the university campus. 
                            Earlier, in the colonial era, college libraries occupied a single room in a multipurpose building; and then in the nineteenth century, 
                            larger colleges such as <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> constructed dedicated library buildings&#x2014;in either neoclassical or (modeled on the English universities) Gothic Revival styles&#x2014;which 
                            sat on the edge of campus and functioned more as glorified book repositories than as circulating libraries. Starting in the late nineteenth century, 
                            with the erection of vast and imposing library buildings, situated at the center of a revised campus plan, a new message was conveyed: 
                            &#x201c;educators considered these structures to be ennobling, uplifting students by providing them with opportunities for cultural improvement, 
                            whether by studying library books or the building that housed the books&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GYUREHEARTOFTHEUNIVERSITY"><persName corresp="#DAGYURE">Gyure</persName>, &#x201c;The Heart of the University&#x201d;</ref>, passim and 119). 
                            The architectural rhetoric mixed overwhelming cultural authority with individualistic aspiration and enfranchisement&#x2014;values 
                            that are combined in a challenging and disconcerting fashion in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s lectures about books and reading, <title type="book" corresp="#JRSESAME">Sesame and Lilies</title> (<date when="1865">1865</date>). 
                            During the golden age of American university library building, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s book servied as a universal school prize&#x2014;small presentation volumes, 
                            which were tricked out as decoratively within their means as the ornate buildings to which the prizes were meant to direct the grateful recipient.</p>
                        
                        <p>While James Gamble Rogers may have been no ideologue according to <persName corresp="#PGOLDBERGER">Goldberger</persName>, 
                            he did contend for maintaining &#x201c;religion, or at least a version of it, at the Yale center&#x201d;, according to another architectural historian; 
                            like other campus planners and library architects of his period, Rogers proposed &#x201c;creating a new kind of sacred space for the modern American university&#x2014;a 
                            cathedral library laden with quasi&#x2010;religious iconography&#x201d;. Not only did the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName>&#x02bc;s structural plan encase 
                            &#x201c;the functions of a modern library within the shell of a neo&#x2010;Gothic cathedral&#x201d;; the building&#x02bc;s elaborate decoration scheme of Gothic detail 
                            encompassed an extensive iconographic program, which was perceived as important enough to sacrifice 
                            &#x201c;six tiers of book stacks in order to fund more ornament&#x201d; in stone and wood carving, glass and mural painting, and other media 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GRUBIAKSTERLINGLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#MMGRUBIAK">Grubiak</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#GRUBIAKSTERLINGLIBRARY">&#x201C;Reassessing Yale&#x02BC;s Cathedral Orgy&#x201D;</title></ref>, 171, 174, 178). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books on architecture were well&#x2010;known primers for reading iconographic programs, although the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName>&#x02bc;s scheme 
                            appears not to have incoporated a direct homage to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STERLINGLIBRARY">&#x201c;The Sterling Memorial Library&#x201d;</ref>).</p>
