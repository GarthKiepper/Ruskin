                <p>On <date when="1930-07-24"> 24 July 1930</date>, <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName> held an important sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s literary remains, described in the catalogue&#x02BC;s title as the 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><hi rend="italic">Manuscripts and Remaining Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>, Removed from His Residence, <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName>, and Sold with the Consent of <persName corresp="#AS">Arthur Severn</persName>, Esq., and of His Trustees</hi></title></ref>. 
                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library, of which more than half (lots 24&#x2013;83) was devoted to <title type="book" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">&#x201C;The Kate Greenaway Collection from Brantwood&#x201D;</title>, while the remainder ranged 
                    from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. As indicated by a copy of the catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName> 
                    that was annotated by an observer during the sale, coveted items fetching high prices in this part of the sale included the <title type="book" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway books</title>  
                    and a copy of <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition of <persName corresp="#EY">Young</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#EYNIGHTTHOUGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi></title>, its engravings &#x201C;coloured by the artist himself&#x201D;. 
                    <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s must have anticipated that the <title type="book" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> would command interest, having devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                    as compared with only two plates showing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts. 
                    Still, as suggested by the final selling prices noted in the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue, the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts reserved for the second half of the sale were considered the gems of the occasion. 
                    Whereas the highest prices in the first part of the sale included &#x00A3;400 for the <persName corresp="#WBP">Blake</persName> <title type="poem" corresp="#EYNIGHTTHOUGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi></title> and &#x00A3;420 for a collection 
                    autograph letters from <persName corresp="#CKG">Greenaway</persName> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, prices for the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts ranged from &#x00A3;440 for the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi></title>, 
                    &#x00A3;520 for a collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s letters to his father, and &#x00A3;1,600 for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s diaries.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscript portion of the sale was advertised in the <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930">catalogue</title> as the 
                    &#x201C;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts from Brantwood: A large and highly important collection of autograph letters, diaries, note-books, poems, etc.,

                    The sale was divided into lots 110&#x2013;22, of which the following pertain to the contents of the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> archive:</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item n="1">Lot 110, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">&#x201C;Letters to His Father</title>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x201D;, items 1&#x2013;6 as numbered in the catalogue, 
                            each item consisting of a 4<hi rend="super">o</hi> blue&#x2010;morocco and gilt binding containing letters, 6 volumes in total. 
                            Item 1, the first volume, entitled in the catalogue as &#x201C;Early Poems&#x201D;, corresponds to 
                            <ref type="ms" target="msxi.html"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title></ref>. The catalogue description does not mention that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> had assigned a roman&#x2010;numeral designation to this collection in 
                            <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title> (see <ref type="essay" target="editing_essay.php">Introductory Essay on Editing and Bibliography</ref>; and

                            and indeed, while <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1891">1891</date> description of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title> as an 
                            &#x201C;envelope containing collected loose papers&#x201D;  had been updated in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> 
                            as &#x201C;now [in <date when="1903">1903</date>] bound up in a volume of letters and poems&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title>, 2:534),</ref> 
                            by <date when="1930">1930</date> even that description had become inaccurate, owing to rebinding (see

                            from the catalogue description of &#x201C;Early Poems (8), beginning with <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESHIP1827">&#x2018;Look at that Ship&#x2019;</title>, dated <date notBefore="1828-02" notAfter="1828-03">Feb. or March, 1828</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was nine years old&#x201D;, along with 137 letters, <date notBefore="1829" notAfter="1859">1829&#x2013;59</date>.</item>
                        <item n="2">Lot 111, &#x201C;Holograph Diaries and Notebooks&#x201D;, items 1&#x2013;27</item><!-- Finish with diaries relevant to ERM -->
                        <item n="3">Lot 112, &#x201C;Early Poems and Juvenilia&#x201D;, items I&#x2013;VI, each item consisting of a blue&#x2010;morocco slipcase, which contained manuscripts as follows. 
                            (The slipcases are not individually described in the catalogue, but they remain along with their original contents at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName>. Starting in the <date notBefore="1990-01" notAfter="1999-12">1990s</date>, to guard against wear, 
                            the manuscripts were no longer stored inside the slipcases). As the catalogue acknowledges (p. 20), to describe the manuscripts, it relies on <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                           <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE"> &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title> in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1891">1891</date>) 
                            (see <ref type="essay" target="editing_essay.php">Introductory Essay on Editing and Bibliography</ref>; and 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_for_major_mss_note.xml">System of Title Citation for Manuscripts</ref>), 
                            citing <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s roman&#x2010;numeral designations for the respective manuscripts, and borrowing condensed versions of his descriptions of the contents (items I.1&#x2013;3, 5; II&#x2013;V). 
                            Only the sizes and physical descriptions use <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s own, more exacting terms. 
                            It is noteworthy that, in context of rare&#x2010;book and manuscript dealing, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s edition remained authoritative, 
                            and the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.xml"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> is not mentioned, although the latter documents items I.4 and VI, 
                            which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</title> omits.

                                    The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: &#x201C;74&#x2013;84&#x2013;84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                    half roan, 6 &#x00D7; 4 in.&#x201D; This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                    contained in these manuscripts. The material &#x201C;half roan&#x201D; is incorrect, however&#x2014;the notebooks being full roan, like the

                                    only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a 
                                    leaf now missing from the third of these notebooks was still attached at the time of the sale, since that possibility would account for the catalogue&#x02BC;s identical

                <p>The manuscripts listed in lots 110, 112, and 114, as described in the catalogue with their slipcases and bindings, are now held by the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library</orgName>, <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University</orgName>.  
                    When first acquired, these lots, in the eyes of the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> curators, would have formed a unit tied together not only by their contents, which all relate to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, but even by their blue&#x2010;morocco casings, 
                    which appear to be unique to these manuscripts. Whoever was originally responsible for this choice of bindings probably did perceive the manuscripts as forming a group, 
                    a perception likely founded in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bibliographical preparation for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title>

                <p>While lots 110 112, and 114 ended up at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, the identity of their initial buyer, and the details of the manuscripts&#x02BC; journey between <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#NEWHAVEN">New Haven</placeName>, are obscured by conflicting evidence. 
                    Lot 112, containing the twelve &#x201C;little notebooks&#x201D;, was, according to <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Charles Beecher Hogan</persName>, 
                    &#x201C;purchased by Mr. <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Goodspeed</persName>&#x201D;, the <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName> book dealer, &#x201C;en bloc at <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s&#x201D;, &#x201C;and in turn purchased by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> also notes that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> acquired the

                    &#x201C;were purchased by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> at the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> auction of <date when="1930-07-24">July 24, 1930</date>&#x201D;, suggesting that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> did not go through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> for these manuscripts

                    Curiously, in <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s memoir, the dealer acknowledges acquiring the manuscripts of <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">The King of the Golden River</hi></title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"> <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> (Lot 121),

                    If <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> is correct, the &#x201C;others&#x201D; must have included Lot 112 containing the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title>, as well, but <persName corresp="CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> is almost certainly incorrect about that lot coming to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> turned all this around to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> for &#x0024;3,000&#x2014;throwing in, apparently as a kind of bonus, a collection of 47 autograph <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> letters, chiefly to <persName corresp="#BJOWETT">Benjamin Jowett</persName>. 
                        The latter had no connection to the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> sale that is detectable in the catalogue.</note> 
                    These items acquired by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> in November were sold at auction, according to the annotated sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName>, to <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">&#x201C;Stevens B.

                    In <date when="1930">1930</date>, <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> himself attended the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s sale and bid in his own name

                    and so <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> would have been free to work on commission for <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, if such was the arrangement. While there was doubtless rivalry between <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName>, and other collectors, 
                    however, <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> appears to have been bound to them by respect for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. A key figure in these relationships was <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, who, on his death in <date when="1931-08">August 1931</date>, 
                    <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">Brown</orgName> remembered to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> as &#x201C;our friend&#x201D; and &#x201C;a sad loss to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lovers as his knowledge and kindly interest was always at the disposal of those, who like himself, admired the great Victorian&#x201D; 
                    (AL, <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">Brown</orgName> to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, <date when="1931-08-29">29 August 1931</date>).</p><!-- don't know what this collection is named -->
                <p>It was probably <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName> who acquired lot 112, the juvenilia, at the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale. According to the annotated sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName>, the successful bid was place by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">&#x201C;Allen&#x201D;</persName> for &#x00A3;260, 
                    who also acquired lot 110 (the letters) for &#x00A3;520. <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s part in the <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1931">1930&#x2013;31</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s sales can be gathered from a letter by <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> to <persName corresp="#JHW">J.

                    on the occasion of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_severn_1931_note.html">Severn Sale of Ruskin Effects, <date when="1931">1931</date></ref>: 
                    &#x201C;we are having the benefit of the assistance of our friend Mr. <persName corresp="#ALLENH"> Hugh Allen</persName>, 
                    and his help has been invaluable&#x201D;, as compared with &#x201C;the lack of interest shown by the Severn family in all matters pertaining to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201D;

                    Thus, while there is no evidence supporting <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>&#x02BC;s claim that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> bought lot 112,<note>The provenance of lot 112 is not <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>&#x02BC;s only error; he also declares that the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPROSERPINA"><hi rend="italic">Proserpina</hi></title>

                        A part of this manuscript did come from the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931.php"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts, <date when="1931">1931</date></title></ref> via <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,

                    in supplying the university library with both lots 112 and 110 from the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s sale. 
                    Whatever <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s involvement, if any, the lots came to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> from <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName> as a unit, as they are treated together 
                    in the earliest published report on <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02BC;s acquisitions from the <date when="1930-07">July 1930</date> sale. Appearing in <date when="1931-01">January 1931</date>, the report 
                    treats the juvenilia along with the letters as a single &#x201C;collection&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS"><persName corresp="#KGWEIHE">Weihe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WEIHERUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">&#x201C;A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                    What remains enigmatic is that this published report makes no mention of the several items, including the <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi></title> manuscript, 
                    which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> certainly did sell to the library the previous November.</p>
                <p>Whomever or whatever interest <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName> represented, his expenditure on lots 110 and 112 was significant, attesting to the value placed on these early manuscripts, 
                    presumably for their biographical interest. At &#x00A3;520, 
                    the letters fetched the second highest price of the manuscript lots after the &#x00A3;1,600 for the diaries, higher even than the &#x00A3;440 paid for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi></title> 
                    materials. The &#x00A3;260 for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title> was significantly more than what <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">B. F. Stevens</orgName> paid for the <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi></title> and the 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> manuscripts, at &#x00A3;155 and &#x00A3;166, respectively. Insofar as prices serve as a measure, manuscripts related to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth that the author referenced
