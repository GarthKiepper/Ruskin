                    described in the sale catalogue&#x02BC;s title as the

                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</p>

                        <p>The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library, 
                            of which more than half (lots 24&#x2013;83) was devoted to the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">&#x201C;<persName corresp="#CKG">Kate Greenaway</persName> Collection from Brantwood&#x201D;</title>, 
                            while the remainder ranged from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> must have anticipated that the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> would command interest, 
                            having devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                            as compared with only two plates showing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts. 
                            The expectation was justified, as indicated by a copy of the sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName> 
                            that was annotated by an observer. Almost every lot in <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> found a buyer, 
                            with the highest price of &#x00A3;420 paid for a collection of autograph letters from <persName corresp="#CKG">Greenaway</persName> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Among the books unrelated to <persName corresp="#CKG">Greeanway</persName>, a copy of <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition of

                            while other lots either were left unsold or their buyers unrecorded by the annotator. The <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue 
                            fails to note, for example, two items of incunabula as well as two lots of Walter Scott novels that, 
                            according to James S. Dearden, were purchased by J. H. Whitehouse

                                                although admittedly the reference is rather deeply buried in the bibliography volume 
                                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:206). 
                                                The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: &#x201C;74&#x2013;84&#x2013;84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                                half roan, 6 &#x00D7; 4 in.&#x201D; This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                                contained in these manuscripts. The material &#x201C;half roan&#x201D; is incorrect, however&#x2014;the notebooks being full roan, like the 
                                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.xml"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title></ref> in I.1&#x2013;5, above&#x2014;and the catalogue&#x02BC;s page count of the notebooks 
                                                only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a 
                                                leaf now missing from the third of these notebooks was still attached at the time of the sale, since that possibility would account for the catalogue&#x02BC;s identical

                            it was the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts reserved for the second half of the sale that commanded the highest prices, 
                            according to the notations in the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue. 
                            Prices ranged from &#x00A3;440 for the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi></title>, 
                            to &#x00A3;520 for a collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s letters to his father, 
                            to &#x00A3;1,600 for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s diaries. 
                            The Stones manuscript and the diaries were acquired by Whitehouse, who spent a total of &#x00A3;2,089 at the sale, 
                            thus assuring that his collection, Dearden writes, held "its position at the head of Ruskin collections" 
                            (Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood, 55).</p>
                        
                        <p>Whitehouse had competitors, however, who adopted an alternative strategy to seeking high-profile items such as the diaries and manuscripts 
                            of the better-known Ruskin works. The Boston bookseller and collector, Charles E. Goodspeed, 
                            who had long been supplying American collectors with Ruskin first editions, had previously "found no competition" in London 
                            for the hundreds of Ruskin items beyond the typical antiquarian dealer's core of first-edition (or earlier edition) volumes of 
                            Modern Painters, Seven Lamps, and Stones (Goodspeed, Yankee Bookseller, 263; 
                            and see <persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> [<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>]). 
                            Goodspeed took the same approach at the 1930 Sotheby's sale, assisted by B. F. Stevens and Brown as his agent. 
                            Whereas Whitehouse's manuscript acquisitions were canonical by the standards of the time--the diaries, 
                            the Stones manuscript, and lot 119, which was headed by manuscript for Ruskin's Turner Catalogue--Goodspeed 
                            targeted very early and very late works: for example, manuscripts of The King of the Golden River (lot 114, &#x00A3;155), 
                            a portion of Fors Clavigera (lot 118, &#x00A3;50), and Praeterita (&#x00A3;155). His strategy is consistent with the biographical bias 
                            animating collectors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who aspired to comprehensive ownership 
                            of every published item by their modern authors of choice, from juvenilia to last works (see 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">The Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>; and see

                        <p>In his 1937 autobiography, Goodspeed mentions that he acquired the King, Fors, and Praeterita manuscripts, 
                            and that he kept the Praeterita manuscript for himself, selling the other two 
                            (Yankee Bookseller, 267). Evidence at the Beinecke Library shows that his buyer for the King and Fors manuscripts was Yale University Library, 
                            and that the transfer was quick, sold in early November 1930. Evidence also reveals that Goodspeed's agent acquired additional manuscripts on his behalf at the 1930 sale, 
                            which, although Goodspeed fails to mention the items in his autobiography, he also sold to Yale University Library on the same date:

                        <p>The Beinecke at Yale also holds the contents of lots 110 and 112, the Ruskin family letters and the collection of juvenilia. 
                            How did these items come to Yale? According to the annotated sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName>, 
                            the successful bids for these two lots were placed by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">&#x201C;Allen&#x201D;</persName> (lot 110, &#x00A3;520; lot 112, &#x00A3;260). 
                            This member of the George Allen family was probably <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, whose role in the sale 
                            can be gathered from a letter by <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> of <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> 
                            to <persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName> on the occasion of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_severn_1931_note.php">Severn Sale of Ruskin Effects, <date when="1931">1931</date></ref>: 
                            &#x201C;we are having the benefit of the assistance of our friend Mr. <persName corresp="#ALLENH"> Hugh Allen</persName>, 
                            and his help has been invaluable&#x201D;, as compared with &#x201C;the lack of interest shown by the Severn family in all matters pertaining to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201D; 
                            (quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINBEMBRIDGEBRANTWOOD"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINBB"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin, Bembridge, and Brantwood</hi></title></ref>, 87). 
                            Beyond the initial purchase of lots 110 and 112 by Allen, however, the details of the manuscripts&#x02BC; journey 
                            from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#NEWHAVEN">New Haven</placeName> are obscured by conflicting evidence.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Charles Beecher Hogan</persName>, lot 112 containing the twelve &#x201C;little notebooks&#x201D; of juvenilia were 
                            &#x201C;purchased by Mr. <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Goodspeed</persName>&#x201D; when they were auctioned &#x201C;en bloc at <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s&#x201D;, 
                            and &#x201C;in turn" these items were "purchased by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x201D;. It seems odd that Goodspeed 
                            would have commissioned two agents at the sale--Allen, as well as Stevens and Brown--unless, for some reason, Allen acted in concert 
                            with Stevens and Brown to obtain these two particular lots. Adding to the confusion, <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> says that the volumes of letters (lot 110) &#x201C;were purchased by 
                            <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> at the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> auction of <date when="1930-07-24">July 24, 1930</date>&#x201D;--a 
                            vague statement, suggesting either that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> did not transact through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> for lot 110, 
                            or that Goodspeed's mediation is to be taken for granted by the reader. The latter assumption should have been forestalled 
                            by a footnote specifying that "other items that came from Brantwood, through Sotheby and Goodspeed" have been "marked 
                            with an asterisk". Hogan does not attach an asterisk to "the magnificent assemblage of Ruskin's letters" at Yale, 
                            leading one to the conclusion that Yale acquired the letters, lot 110, directly through the agency of Hugh Allen, 
                            while lot 112 came roundabout to Yale, from Allen to Goodspeed to the university library. Confidence in this chain of reasoning 
                            is shaken by Hogan's careless writing, however, since he also attributes "volumes" of Ruskin letters at Yale 
                            to an "auction at Sotheby's in 1936", leaving unclear whether he means that this sale accounted for all the bound volumes of letters 
                            or solely "five further volumes containing transcribed and typewritten copies that were collected by Messrs. Cook and Wedderburn during the preparation of their great edition of Ruskin's works"

                    When first acquired, these lots, in the eyes of the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> curators, would have formed a unit tied together not only by their contents, which all relate to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, but even by their blue&#x2010;morocco casings, 
                    which appear to be unique to these manuscripts. Whoever was originally responsible for this choice of bindings probably did perceive the manuscripts as forming a group, 
                    a perception likely founded in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bibliographical preparation for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title>

                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> turned all this around to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> for &#x0024;3,000&#x2014;throwing in, apparently as a kind of bonus, a collection of 47 autograph <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> letters, chiefly to <persName corresp="#BJOWETT">Benjamin Jowett</persName>. 
                        The latter had no connection to the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> sale that is detectable in the catalogue. 
                    These items acquired by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> in November were sold at auction, according to the annotated sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName>, to <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSBROWN">&#x201C;Stevens B.

                <p>It was only a few years earlier, in <date when="1927">1927</date>, that <persName corresp="#RBROWN">Ralph Brown</persName> had established what would prove a thirty&#x2010;year relationship with the important English Ruskin collector,

                    In <date when="1930">1930</date>, <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> himself attended the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s sale and bid in his own name

                    and so <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">Stevens &#x0026; Brown</orgName> would have been free to work on commission for <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, if such was the arrangement.

A key figure in these relationships was <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Hugh Allen</persName>, who, on his death in <date when="1931-08">August 1931</date>, 
                    <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">Brown</orgName> remembered to <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> as &#x201C;our friend&#x201D; and &#x201C;a sad loss to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lovers as his knowledge and kindly interest was always at the disposal of those, who like himself, admired the great Victorian&#x201D;

                        A part of this manuscript did come from the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931.php"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts, <date when="1931">1931</date></title></ref> via <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>,
                        but the holding started with lot 117 from the <date when="1930">1930</date> sale, as explained above.</note> the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title>, from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, it is possible that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> served as a conduit between <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> and <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName>, 
                    in supplying the university library with both lots 112 and 110 from the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s sale. 
                    Whatever <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02BC;s involvement, if any, the lots came to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> from <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName> as a unit, as they are treated together 
                    in the earliest published report on <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x02BC;s acquisitions from the <date when="1930-07">July 1930</date> sale. Appearing in <date when="1931-01">January 1931</date>, the report 
                    treats the juvenilia along with the letters as a single &#x201C;collection&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLECTIONRUSKINMANUSCRIPTS"><persName corresp="#KGWEIHE">Weihe</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WEIHERUSKINMANUSCRIPTS">&#x201C;A Collection of Ruskin Manuscripts&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                    What remains enigmatic is that this published report makes no mention of the several items, including the <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi></title> manuscript, 
                    which <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> certainly did sell to the library the previous November.</p>
                <p>Whomever or whatever interest <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName> represented, his expenditure on lots 110 and 112 was significant, attesting to the value placed on these early manuscripts, 
                    presumably for their biographical interest. At &#x00A3;520, 
                    the letters fetched the second highest price of the manuscript lots after the &#x00A3;1,600 for the diaries, higher even than the &#x00A3;440 paid for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE"><hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi></title> 
                    materials. The &#x00A3;260 for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#JRREDBOOK">Red Books</title> was significantly more than what <orgName corresp="#BFSTEVENSANDBROWN">B. F. Stevens</orgName> paid for the <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">King of the Golden River</hi></title> and the 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> manuscripts, at &#x00A3;155 and &#x00A3;166, respectively. Insofar as prices serve as a measure, manuscripts related to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth that the author referenced 
                    in the autobiography were valued more than 
                    the manuscript of the autobiography itself. (<persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> clung to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> manuscript, and treasured it, however; and it is interesting that, 
                    while prices for the late works were, not surprisingly, comparatively low, <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1942">1942</date> article treated &#x201C;the possession of the manuscripts of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title> 
                    and the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>&#x201D; as what &#x201C;makes the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> collection truly rich&#x201D; 
                    [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#YALECOLLECTION"><persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#YALECOLLECTION">&#x201C;Yale Collection of the Manuscripts of John Ruskin&#x201D;</title></ref>, 68].) It is possible, moreover, that the comparatively high prices 
                    for the early manuscripts was the effect not only of the interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth that the author himself had encouraged through his autobiographical writing, but also of the broader 
                    phenomenon of <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">The Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth
