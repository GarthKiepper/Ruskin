                <head type="title">Hypothyroidism in the Alps</head>
                <p>Hypothyroidism is defined as a condition of "mild to severe impairment of physical and mental development due to an untreated deficiency of thyroid hormones", 
                    and historically the condition has been endemic to regions with diets deficient in iodine. The resulting disorders include goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) 
                    and the severe stunting of development that in the nineteenth century was called <hi rend="italic">cretinism</hi>. 
                    Many Alpine regions are severely deficient in iodine, so that travelers came to associate Switzerland with these disorders. 
                    Yet variations among cantons in soil geology and water supply, along with such accidental circumstances as access to an iodine-rich salt mine, 
                    led to sharply localized differences in the incidence of goiter and cretinism in France, Switzerland, and Italy, 
                    which mystified researchers attempting to isolate a cause. Not until the 1920s did researchers successfully identify the cause 
                    and undertake a program to supplement the deficiency in diet

                <p>On the evidence of <note type="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php">Mary Richardson</note>'s diary, the Ruskins first came face to face 
                    with victims of severe goiter and cretinism--at least, on a widespread scale--in Sion, the chief municipality of Canton Valais, where she, John, and John James on a walk through town 
                    considered it "dirty and desolate looking, and the people all miserable creatures, two out of three hav[ing] goitre very bad, and many of them . . . idiots" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 69). 
                    Valais was indeed known for the affliction: in 1800, Napoleon ordered a census, which counted 4,000 cretins among 70,000 inhabitants of the canton; 
                    and as late as 1920, a national survey of young men's eligibility for military service discovered the greatest density of disqualifying goiter, 
                    in the southern half of the country, lay around Sion and Martigny 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM">Papageorgopoulou, Staub, and R&#x00FC;hli, "Hypothyroidism in Switzerland"</ref>, 80, 82). 
                    Guidebooks published in the 1830s warned British travelers about the phenomenon particularly in connection with this part of of the Rh&#x00F4;ne valley 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><persName corresp="#JGE">Ebel</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">Traveller&#x02BC;s Guide through Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 361;

                <p>Nineteenth-century British writers compared the proposed environmental causes of hypthyroidism, and finding them inconsistent advanced 
                    their own theories, confident of their personal observations. In 1827-29, William Brockedon favored the attribution to "dirty habits": 
                    "The author has adopted an opinion, arising from extensive observation, that one of the chief causes of these complaints 
                    is to be found in the dirty habits of the communities afflicted. This is an opinion entertained by the clean and healthy mountaineers, 
                    who are free from goitre, and by the inhabitants of those valleys where personal cleanliness is regarded: 
                    for this the Anzascans [i.e., inhabitants of Anzasca valley], a race of fine men and beautiful women, 
                    are remarkable; whilst the dirty wretches where the affliction is found, sty all the winter with their cattle, 
                    seldom or never change their clothes, and dread water as if their disease were hydrophobia. Three or four filthy generations produce goitre, 
                    and it requires as many of clean habits to remove the punishment for their foul offences" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi></title></ref>,

                <p>According to John Murray III in 1838, "careful attention to the circumstances accompanying its [goiter's] appearance 
                    will show that it is connected with the condition of the atmosphere, and is found in low, warm, and moist situations, 
                    at the bottom of valleys, where a stagnation of water occurs, and where the summer exhalations and autumnal fogs arising from it 
                    are not carried off by a free circulation of air. It is found in places where the valley is confined, and shut in, as it were--where 
                    a free draft is checked by its sides being clothed with wood, or by a sudden bend occurring in its direction--where, at the same time, 
                    the bottom is subject to the overflowings of a river, or to extensive artificial irrigation. The conjecture which derives the disease 
                    from breathing an atmosphere of this kind, not liable to be purified by fresh currents of air to carry off the vapours, 
                    is, perhaps, the one most deserving of consideration"
