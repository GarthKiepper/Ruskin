                <head>Janet ("Jessie") Richardson (1783-1828)</head>
                <p>Sister of John James Ruskin, married in 1804 to <!-- ref note -->Patrick Richardson (1774-1824) of Perth, Scotland, 
                    and mother of ten children. Six of the ten had died by the time Jessie herself died on 18 May 1828. In Praeterita, 
                    Ruskin not improbably conveyed his description of her in terms of child deaths
                    (Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:xlviii-xlix, 8 n. 1; Viljoen, Ruskin's Scottish Heritage, 183, 185, 157; 
                    Ruskin, Works, 35:65).
                </p>
                <p>When Jessie died on 18 May, the Ruskins were embarked on the <!-- ref note -->Tour of 1828, 
                    where they received the news on 24 May. John James acted immediately to make arrangements for the now orphaned, surviving children 
                    of Jessie and Patrick--the sons John Ruskin Richardson (1807-74), <!-- ref note -->William Richardson (1811-75), 
                    and Andrew Richardson (b. 1817); and the daughter <!-- ref note -->Mary Richardson (1815-49). 
                    John James was one of five trustees of a settlement by Jessie's husband, <!-- ref note -->Patrick Richardson (1774-1824) 
                    (Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:197-98 n. 1. 
                    His accounts show that, before 1828, he had already been supporting Mary's and William's educations, as well as sending 
                    money to his sister. In 1828 the headings of the expense lists for family charity change from "Mrs Richardson my Sister at Perth" to 
                    "John, Mary, And<hi rend="superscript">w</hi> &#x0026; Will<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Richardson" in 1829, 
                    and then to "Mary, Will<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> &#x0026; And<hi rend="superscript">w</hi> Richardson" in 1830--John Ruskin Richardson 
                    now being on his own, although John James probably helped him break into the wine business
                    (Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:14-15 n. 3; John James Ruskin, Account Book [1827-45], 4v, 13v, 18r, 23r)</p>
