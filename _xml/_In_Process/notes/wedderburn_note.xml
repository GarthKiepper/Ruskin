                <head>Alexander D. O. (Dundas Ogilvy) Wedderburn (1854&#x2013;1931)</head>
                <p>Ruskin&#x02BC;s secretary, 18??&#x2013;<!--Entry needed here-->??; barrister, from <!--Entry needed here-->???; King&#x02BC;s

                <p>Hilton points out that Wedderburn stood apart from his fellow Balliol College
                    followers of Ruskin, Arnold Toynbee and Alfred Milner, ...<!-- Entry needed here --></p>
                <p>After Ruskin&#x02BC;s death, by terms of the will, Wedderburn was named literary trustee
                    along with Charles Eliot Norton and Joan Severn. He also received a third of the
                    profits from books (subsequently?<!-- Entry needed here -->) edited or revised by him, along with Â£100 a
                    year to supervise sales. In 1900, on Ruskin&#x02BC;s death, Wedderburn advised Allen
                    and the trustees that, to maintain copyright, they should issue new editions of
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s works incorporating formerly unpublished material. </p>
                <p>Wedderburn appears to have been responsible for arranging and binding
                    Ruskin&#x02BC;s manuscripts after 1900, once work began on the Library
                    Edition, and he prepared the catalog of manuscripts for the bibliography volume
                    (vol. 38). </p>
