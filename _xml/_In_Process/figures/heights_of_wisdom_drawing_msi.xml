                    <p>Emblems formed from simple allegorical texts and images were familiar to Ruskin from illustrations to his books for children. For example,

                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#SOBERSIDES">Solomon Sobersides</persName>, which was owned by Ruskin (undated edition), 
                        contains a woodcut frontispiece accompanying a verse describing the contest between Wisdom and Folly to lead the steps of youth:

                                        <l>The Paths of Life, securely tread;</l>
                                        <l>The dang'rous Lures of Folly shun,</l>
                                        <l>And Virtue's Course serenely run.</l>
                                    </lg>

                        The woodcut is described as "a masterpiece of its kind" in the essay introducing the copy of the book in the Hockliffe Project: 
                        "Wisdom (looking rather like Britannia) [is] giving a book to a young boy, while Folly (distinguished by her fool's hat) 
                        tries to distract him with a rattle. Behind them, we see the solid and magnificent temple built by Wisdom, 
                        and the ruined temple which must be the result of heeding the 'Lures of Folly'" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE"><title type="archive" corresp="#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE">&#x201C;Stories before 1850. 0220: Anon. [&#x2018;Solomon Sobersides&#x2019;], Christmas Tales&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        The emblem is adapted to a child's text by putting a youth in the place of the classical hero in compositions such as 
                        <title type="artwork" corresp="#BATONIHERCULES"><hi rend="italic">Hercules at the Crossroads</hi></title>, which, 
                        in the 1748 version by Pompeo Girolamo Batoni, 
                        depicts the seated naked hero weighing the alternatives offered on the one hand by Venus and on the other 
                        by the armored figure of Minerva, who points to the Temple of Fame on a hill. (In the Christmas Tales frontispiece, 
                        both Wisdom's temple and Folly's ruin sit atop hills.)</p>
