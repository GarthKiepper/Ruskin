                        came to haddington where&#x2010;<lb/>
                        harry expected to see the sea&#x2010;<lb/>

                        ning went on to boroughbridge.  the reason it was called<lb/>
                        so was that a very beautiful bridge was in the<lb/>
                        town the room which they had got had a book<lb/>

                        for there they had a complete view of<lb/>

                       trees through which they passed to go in<lb/>
                       to the town  well from this avenue the high&#x2010;<lb/>
                       towers of the cathedral gilded by the rays<lb/>
                       of the sun and the mountains at a distance<lb/>
                       looked so beautiful that people must see it<lb/>

                       not equal this and what made the bass<lb/>
                       the more charming was that the bass<lb/>
                       was seen at sunset while this was seen<lb/>
