                <p>Hypothyroidism is defined as a condition of "mild to severe impairment of physical and mental development due to an untreated deficiency of thyroid hormones". 
                    Historically, the condition has been endemic to regions with diets deficient in iodine. The resulting disorders include goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) 
                    and the severe stunting of development that in the nineteenth century was called <hi rend="italic">cretinism</hi>. 
                    Many Alpine regions are severely deficient in iodine, with the result that, prior to the twentieth century, travelers came to associate Switzerland with these disorders. 
                    Yet regional variations in soil geology and water supply, along with such accidental circumstances as access to an iodine-rich salt mine, 
                    led to sharply localized differences in the incidence of goiter and cretinism in parts France, Switzerland, and Italy, 
                    which mystified researchers attempting to isolate a cause. Not until the 1920s did researchers successfully link the disorders with iodine deficiency 
                    and undertake a program in Switzerland to supplement the deficiency in diet, which produced dramatic improvements in health

                <p>On the evidence of <note type="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php">Mary Richardson</note>'s diary, the Ruskins first came face to face 
                    with victims of severe goiter and cretinism--at least, on a widespread scale--in Sion, the chief municipality of Canton Valais, where she, John, and John James on a walk through town 
                    found it "dirty and desolate looking", and in Mary's view "the people all miserable creatures, two out of three hav[ing] goitre very bad, and many of them . . . idiots" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 69). 
                    Valais was indeed known for these afflictions: in 1800, Napoleon ordered a census, which counted 4,000 cretins among 70,000 inhabitants of the canton; 
                    and as late as 1920, a national survey of young men's eligibility for military service discovered that, in the southern half of the country, 
                    the greatest density of disqualifying goiter lay around Sion and Martigny 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PAPAGEORGOPOULOUHYPOTHYROIDISM">Papageorgopoulou, Staub, and R&#x00FC;hli, "Hypothyroidism in Switzerland"</ref>, 80, 82). 
                    Guidebooks published in the 1830s warned British travelers about the phenomenon, particularly in connection with the Rh&#x00F4;ne valley in the Valais 
                    (e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><persName corresp="#JGE">Ebel</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">Traveller&#x02BC;s Guide through Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 361; 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 156).</p>
                
                <p>In guidebooks such as these, nineteenth-century British writers compared environmental causes that were commonly proposed for hypthyroidism, 
                    and finding the evidence inconsistent advanced their own theories, confident in the shrewdness of their personal observations. 
                    In 1827-29, William Brockedon favored the idea that the disorders arose from "dirty habits": 
                    "The author", Brockedon wrote about himself, "has adopted an opinion, arising from extensive observation, that one of the chief causes of these complaints 
                    is to be found in the dirty habits of the communities afflicted. This is an opinion entertained by the clean and healthy mountaineers, 
                    who are free from goitre, and by the inhabitants of those valleys where personal cleanliness is regarded: 
                    for this the Anzascans [i.e., inhabitants of Anzasca valley], a race of fine men and beautiful women, 
                    are remarkable; whilst the dirty wretches where the affliction is found, sty all the winter with their cattle, 
                    seldom or never change their clothes, and dread water as if their disease were hydrophobia. Three or four filthy generations produce goitre, 
                    and it requires as many of clean habits to remove the punishment for their foul offences" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi></title></ref>, 
                    <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">&#x201C;The Simplon&#x201D;</geogName>, ??).<!-- p. no. needed --></p>
                
                <p>Writing in 1838, John Murray III insisted for his part that "careful attention to the circumstances accompanying its [goiter's] appearance 
                    will show that it is connected with the condition of the atmosphere, and is found in low, warm, and moist situations, 
                    at the bottom of valleys, where a stagnation of water occurs, and where the summer exhalations and autumnal fogs arising from it 
                    are not carried off by a free circulation of air. It is found in places where the valley is confined, and shut in, as it were--where 
                    a free draft is checked by its sides being clothed with wood, or by a sudden bend occurring in its direction--where, at the same time, 
                    the bottom is subject to the overflowings of a river, or to extensive artificial irrigation. The conjecture which derives the disease 
                    from breathing an atmosphere of this kind, not liable to be purified by fresh currents of air to carry off the vapours, 
                    is, perhaps, the one most deserving of consideration". It was surely no accident that this list of environmental conditions matches exactly 
                    (one wonders if even uniquely matches) those surrounding Martigny, where the Rh&#x00F4;ne makes an almost ninety-degree bend, 
                    and the broad flat of the valley formed a marsh between the extraordinary heights of the Bernese Alps on the north side and the Pennine Alps on the south. 
                    In the section of the guidebook devoted to Martigny, Murray circularly applies his general theory to explain the prevalence of cretinism in the locale 
                    that probably inspired the theory in the first place 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, lix, 156).</p>
                
                <p>The language used by such writers to describe the effects of hypothyroidism is often blunt in its moralizing implications; 
                    no lessons in sympathetic imagination with disability were taken from Wordsworth's <title type="poem" corresp="#WORDSWORTHIDIOTBOY">"The Idiot Boy"</title>. 
                    For Brockedon, cretins are "objects of disgust and pity"; for Murray, "[t]he cretin is an idiot--a melancholy spectacle--a creature who may almost be said to rank a step below a human being. 
                    There is vacancy in his countenance; his head is disproportionately large; his limbs are stunted or crippled; he cannot articulate his words with distinctness; 
                    and there is scarcely any work which he is capable of executing. He spends his days basking in the sun, and, from its warmth, appears to derive great gratification. 
                    When a stranger appears, he becomes a clamorous and importunate beggar, assailing him with a ceaseless chattering; 
                    and the traveller is commonly glad to be rid of his hideous presence at the expense of a batz"
