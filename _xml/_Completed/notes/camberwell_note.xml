                <p>Camberwell is the London suburb in which the Ruskins' home, no. 26 Herne Hill, was located.</p>

                    <p>The Ruskins&#02BC; house stood four miles from the &#x201C;Standard in Cornhill&#x201D; in the City (<persName corresp="#MHILTON">Hilton</persName> 8), 
                        marking the crossroads of <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill</placeName>, Gracechurch Street, 
                        <placeName corresp="#LEADENHALLST">Leadenhall Street</placeName>, and Bishopsgate--very near to <persName corresp="#JR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s business premises 
                        in <placeName corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName> (see City of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>; <persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName>). Travelers between <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName> south of the river 
                        could cross <placeName corresp="#LONDONBRDG">London Bridge</placeName> connecting with Old Camberwell Road, 
                        which ran along the western side of the parish (the most convenient route between <placeName corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>), 
                        or they could take <placeName corresp="#BLACKFRIARSBRIDGE">Blackfriars Bridge</placeName> connecting with the Old Kent road, 
                        which ran along the eastern side of the parish. The traveler inevitably encountered turnpike roads on the south side of the river, 
                        requiring tolls (<persName corresp="#HJDYOS">Dyos</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="#DYOSVICTORIANSUBURB">Victorian Suburb</title>, 64&#x2013;65).</p>
                    <p>The Ruskins did not maintain a carriage of their own (<peersName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, John Ruskin&#x02BC;s Camberwell, 8), 
                        so <persName corresp="#JR">John James Ruskin</persName> must have taken public transport into the

                        According to <persName corresp="#HJDYOS">H. J. Dyos</persName>, by <date when="1834">1834</date> these roads between <placeName corresp="#CAMBERWELL">Camberwell</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> were traversed each day by seventeen coaches 
                        running ninety journeys between them. Omnibuses were introduced in <date when="1835">1835</date>, at first used mainly by casual travelers into the city, 
                        not businessmen who departed earlier than these conveyances started. The frequency of omnibus schedules 
                        accommodating all commuter travel increased at mid&#x2010;century. Then in the 1860s, 
                        railways became a practical means of suburban commuting to and from work in the city. 
                        The preceding decades of rail development was associated with distance travel
