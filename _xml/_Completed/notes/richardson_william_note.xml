                <head type="title">William Richardson (1811-75)</head>
                <p>Along with his sister, Mary Richardson (1815-49)<!-- CITE NOTE -->, William Richardson was educated at John James Ruskin's 
                    expense, especially from the time when they were orphaned by the death of their mother, Jessie Richardson (1783-1828) of Perth, 
                    John James's sister. Unlike Mary, he did not live at Herne Hill with the Ruskins. 
                    William trained as a physician, later becoming the Ruskin family medical advisor; 
                    and he established a prominent practice in Tunbridge Wells, ultimately leaving a mark on diabetes research, 
                    according to Van Akin Burd's biographical note (RFL 51-52 n. 3).</p>
                <p>In Ruskin's youth, William seemed less promising to the Ruskins, Margaret wondering, "will he ever do for a Doctor", 
                    skeptical that "he could get thro the latin classes" considering the limited "knowledge of the english" contained 
                    in one of his letters: "he must be thoroughly stupid but he may be the reverse of King Charles and we may hope 
                    may never do a stupid thing tho' he never either writes or says a wise one" (referring to the quip about Charles II 
                    by the earl of Rochester<!-- Laurence Hyde -->, "He never says a foolish thing, / Nor ever does a wise one"). 
                    Margaret admitted, however, that William "is certainly goodnatured and obliging", 
                    and hoped he "may come to the use of his understanding in time" 
                    (letter to John James Ruskin, 8 May 1827 [RFL 163, and see 165 n. 6])<!-- let's go with this form, thanks -->. 
                    Later, she decided that the "very dullness of his faculties in childhood has induced such habits of constant 
                    laborious study as will at least place him on an equality if he does not go beyond many of far higher genius" 
                    (letter to John James Ruskin, 17 March 1831 [RFL 251]).</p>
