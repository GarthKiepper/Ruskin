                <head type="title">Robert Ellis Cunliffe (ca. 1848-1902)</head>
                <p>Cunliffe assembled a collection of drawings by Ruskin, which the editors of the Library Edition described in 1912 as 
                    "the choicest and most representative" among "private collections" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="books" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:224). 
                    The collection is significant to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> because it was representative in the sense chronologically inclusive, with examples dating from as early as 1833 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="drawings_1833_note.php">Drawings from the <date notBefore="1833-05-14" notAfter="1833-08-19">Tour of 1833</date></ref>). 
                    Cunliffe appears therefore to have been motivated by the biographical approach that characterized late-century collecting (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>). 
                    According to James S. Dearden, Cunliffe acquired most of his drawings from Joan Severn at Brantwood 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENCUNLIFFE"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, &#x201C;The Cunliffe Collection of Ruskin Drawings&#x201D;</ref>, 238).</p>
                
                <p>Dearden numbers 74 drawings in the collection at the time of Cunliffe's death, 66 of which he found listed in the Library Edition's 
                    <title type="catalogue" corresp="#CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">&#x201C;Catalogue of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Drawings&#x201D;</title>

                    In the <title type="catalogue" corresp="#CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">&#x201C;Catalogue&#x201D;</title>, items from the collection are credited to "Mrs. Cunliffe", 
                    because her husband had died prematurely a decade earlier, at age 54, from scarlet fever. He was a Manchester solicitor, retired in 1899 to an estate named the Croft in Ambleside. 
                    In Manchester, he had been active in the <orgName corresp="#MANCHESTERLITERARYCLUB">Literary and Philosophical Society</orgName>, interested mainly in scientific pursuits

                    He and subsequently his wife loaned drawings to early exhibitions, such as the
