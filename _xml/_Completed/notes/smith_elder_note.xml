                <p>John Ruskin's publisher, from his first widely distributed poems in Friendship's Offering to his first book, 
                    Modern Painters (1843), and beyond to the major books of the 1840s and 1850s.</p>
                
                <p>The business began in <date when="1816">1816</date> as a London stationer and bookseller, 
                    founded by two emigre Scotsmen, George Smith (1789-1846) and Alexander Elder (1790-1876). 
                    According to Sidney Lee, the partners undertook their first modest publishing venture in 1819, 
                    when they were admitted to the Stationers' Company, although more recently Bill Bell has shown evidence 
                    that they began publishing in a small way from the beginning in 1816 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3-4;

                    John James Ruskin's initial dealings with the firm appear to have been as a customer of their stationery and books. 
                    For example, an entry in his household accounts for June 1827 shows the notation,
                    &#x201c;Paid for Books to <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith E</orgName>&#x201d;, followed by a list of titles 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS28">Account Book [<date notBefore="1827-01-01" notAfter="1845-12-31">1827&#x2013;45</date>]</title></ref>, 2r;

                    According to a history of the firm, its early days of purveying writing materials, books new and used, and bookbinding catered 
                    to "a friendly Scotch <hi rend="italic">client&#x00E8;le</hi>", as reflected the preponderance of Scottish titles of books and music recorded in a daybook 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></ref>, 4).</p>
                
                <p>When first established, the premises were located in Fenchurch Street, near to the counting house of 
                    Ruskin, Telford, &#x0026; Domecq in Billiter Street, which linked Fenchurch Street to Leadenhall Street 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINEARLYYEARS"><persName corresp="#THILTON">Hilton</persName>, <hi rend="italic">John Ruskin: The Early Years</hi></ref>, 29). 
                    In 1824, the firm moved one street farther west to 65 Cornhill; and taking on a third partner, it became Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company. 
                    An important part of the business was focused on exporting books and stationery to India, 
                    supplying British subjects stationed with the East India Company 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 4-6).</p>
                
                <p>It would have mattered to John James Ruskin that the founders of the firm, George Smith and Alexander Elder were, 
                    like himself, Scotsmen who were the first in their respective families to leave North Britain in order to seek better 
                    mercantile opportunities and cultured, metropolitan lives in London. They also opened a window onto the romance of literary life. 
                    <persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> had served in the firm of <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName>, the publisher of <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, 
                    and even had the honor on one occasion to deliver proof sheets to the poet himself--or, in a more colorful version of the story, 
                    carried an inquiry about a new edition that caused Byron to spring up and dance around the room 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3;

                    It was <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> who oversaw the fledgling publishing arm of the business, however; 
                    and although the earlier memoirs characterize his involvement as "spasmodic", Elder counted as a central figure 
                    for the expatriate literary Scotsmen in London during the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>, 
                    according to <persName corresp="#GH">Gillian Hughes</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7;

                <p>Among the literary Scotsmen surrounding Elder were <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1834">1789&#x2013;1834</date>)</ref> 
                    and <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName> (<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1865">1800&#x2013;1865</date>)--both future editors of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                    <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company</orgName> took over this literary annual in 1827 from a neigboring bookseller 
                    in Cornhill Street, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</persName>, and rapidly developed it from a pale imitation 
                    of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                    into one of the best-selling productions of the two-decade reign of the annuals. The burgeoning innovations in visual and print culture 
                    that made the annuals a popular success--mass-producible illustration, such steel engraving, and mechanized bookbinding and papermaking--proved 
                    particularly effective in the firm's make-over of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> in particular a pop
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>). 
                    Again, Elder's tastes appear to have been key, for he was also an art enthusiast, and commissioned a number of ambitious portfolios of picturesque views, 
                    among the earliest of which was an 1824 series of copper-engraved views of the principal towns and historical sites of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, 
                    published in aquatint, and each plate sold at half a guinea--successfully profiting over the artist's commission of &#x00A3;1,000, 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER">Huxley, <hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></ref>, 10&#x2013;11; 
                    the series was <title type="artwork" corresp="JHCLARKVIEWSINSCOTLAND"><hi rend="italic">Views in Scotland</hi></title>

                    that for <date when="1829">1829</date> (i.e., marketed during the holiday season of <date notBefore="1828-11" notAfter="1829-01">1828&#x2013;29</date>). He served 
                    as editor until his death in <date when="1834-12">December 1834</date>, having prepared the volume for <date when="1835">1835</date> (i.e., for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date>). 
                    This last volume, which featured the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, was substantially completed during the <date notBefore="1834-06-21" notAfter="1834-09-22">summer of 1834</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></ref>, 244). In this volume, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made his first 
                    appearance in a prominent professional anthology, publishing two poems: <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#FRAGMENTS">Fragments from a Metrical Journal</title>,&#x201D;</ref>,

                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s relationship with the Ruskin family was struck considerably earlier than his editing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for the <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date> volume,
