                <p><persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s publisher, from his first widely distributed poems in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02bc;s Offering</hi></title> to his first book, 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#MODERNPAINTERS1"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi></title> (<date when="1843">1843</date>), and beyond to the major books of the <date notBefore="1840-01-01" notAfter="1849-12-31">1840s</date> and <date notBefore="1850-01-01" notAfter="1859-12-31">1850s</date>.</p>
                
                <p>The business began in <date when="1816">1816</date> as a <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> stationer and bookseller, 
                    founded by two emigre Scotsmen, <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName> (<date notBefore="1789-01-01" notAfter="1846-08-21">1789&#x2013;1846</date>) and <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> (<date notBefore="1790-01-01" notAfter="1876-12-31">1790&#x2013;1876</date>). 
                    According to <persName corresp="#SSL">Sidney Lee</persName>, the partners undertook their first modest publishing venture in <date when="1819">1819</date>, 
                    when they were admitted to the <orgName corresp="#STATIONERSCO">Stationers&#x02bc; Company</orgName>, although more recently <persName corresp="#BBELL">Bill Bell</persName> has shown evidence 
                    that they began publishing in a small way from the beginning in <date when="1816">1816</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3&#x2013;4;

                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s initial dealings with the firm appear to have been as a customer of their stationery and books. 
                    For example, an entry in his household accounts for <date when="1827-06">June 1827</date> shows the notation,
                    &#x201c;Paid for Books to <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith E</orgName>&#x201d;, followed by a list of titles

                    According to a history of the firm, its early days of purveying writing materials, books new and used, and bookbinding catered 
                    to &#x201c;a friendly Scotch <hi rend="italic">client&#x00E8;le</hi>&#x201d;, as reflected the preponderance of Scottish titles of books and music recorded in a daybook 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><persName corresp="#LHUXLEY">Huxley</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">The House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 4).</p>
                
                <p>When first established, the premises were located in <placeName corresp="#FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</placeName>, near to the counting house of 
                    <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, &#x0026; Domecq</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName>, which linked <placeName corresp="#FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#LEADENHALLST">Leadenhall Street</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINEARLYYEARS"><persName corresp="#THILTON">Hilton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#HILTONRUSKINEARLYYEARS"><hi rend="italic">John Ruskin: The Early Years</hi></title></ref>, 29). 
                    In <date when="1824">1824</date>, the firm moved one street farther west to 65 <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill</placeName>; and taking on a third partner, it became <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company</orgName>. 
                    An important part of the business was focused on exporting books and stationery to <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>, 
                    supplying British subjects stationed with the <orgName corresp="#EASTINDIACO">East India Company</orgName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 4&#x2013;6).</p>
                
                <p>It would have mattered to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> that the founders of the firm, <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName> and <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName> were, 
                    like himself, Scotsmen who were the first in their respective families to leave <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName> in order to seek better 
                    mercantile opportunities and cultured, metropolitan lives in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>. They also opened a window onto the romance of literary life. 
                    <persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> had served in the firm of <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName>, the publisher of <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, 
                    and even had the honor on one occasion to deliver proof sheets to the poet himself&#x2014;or, in a more colorful version of the story, 
                    carried an inquiry about a new edition that caused <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName> to spring up and dance around the room 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 3;

                    It was <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> who oversaw the fledgling publishing arm of the business, however; 
                    and although the earlier memoirs characterize his involvement as &#x201c;spasmodic&#x201d;, <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> counted as a central figure 
                    for the expatriate literary Scotsmen in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> during the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>, 
                    according to <persName corresp="#GH">Gillian Hughes</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEESMITHMEMOIR"><persName corresp="#SSL">Lee</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#LEESMITHMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith</persName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 7;

                <p>Among the literary Scotsmen surrounding <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName> were <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="pringle_thomas_note.php"><persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName> (<date notBefore="1789" notAfter="1834">1789&#x2013;1834</date>)</ref> 
                    and <persName corresp="#LR">Leitch Ritchie</persName> (<date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1865">1800&#x2013;1865</date>)&#x2014;both future editors of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                    <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company</orgName> took over this literary annual in <date when="1827">1827</date> from a neigboring bookseller 
                    in <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill Street</placeName>, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</persName>, and rapidly developed it from a pale imitation 
                    of <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="annual" corresp="#RAPFORGETMENOT"><hi rend="italic">Forget Me Not</hi></title> 
                    into one of the best&#x2010;selling productions of the two&#x2010;decade reign of the annuals. The burgeoning innovations in visual and print culture 
                    that made the annuals a popular success&#x2014;mass&#x2010;producible illustration, such steel engraving, and mechanized bookbinding and papermaking&#x2014;proved 
                    particularly effective in the firm&#x02bc;s make&#x2010;over of <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title> in particular a pop

                    Again, <persName corresp="#AE">Elder</persName>&#x02bc;s tastes appear to have been key, for he was also an art enthusiast, and commissioned a number of ambitious portfolios of picturesque views, 
                    among the earliest of which was an <date when="1824">1824</date> series of copper&#x2010;engraved views of the principal towns and historical sites of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, 
                    published in aquatint, and each plate sold at half a guinea&#x2014;successfully profiting over the artist&#x02bc;s commission of &#x00A3;1,000 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER">Huxley, <title type="book" corresp="#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER"><hi rend="italic">House of Smith Elder</hi></title></ref>, 10&#x2013;11;

                <p>Starting his editorship in <date when="1828">1828</date>, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s first volume of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> was  
                    that for <date when="1829">1829</date> (i.e., marketed during the holiday season of <date notBefore="1828-11" notAfter="1829-01">1828&#x2013;29</date>). He served 
                    as editor until his death in <date when="1834-12">December 1834</date>, having prepared the volume for <date when="1835">1835</date> (i.e., for the holiday season of <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date>). 
                    This last volume, which featured the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, was substantially completed during the <date notBefore="1834-06-21" notAfter="1834-09-22">summer of 1834</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE">Vigne, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Pringle</hi></ref>, 244). In this volume, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made his first 
                    appearance in a prominent professional anthology, publishing two poems: <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#FRAGMENTS">Fragments from a Metrical Journal</title>,&#x201D;</ref>,

                    <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s relationship with the Ruskin family was struck considerably earlier than his editing of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for the <date notBefore="1834-11" notAfter="1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</date> volume, 
                    for it was either his first volume, for <date when="1829">1829</date>, or his second, for <date when="1830">1830</date>, that was presented as a gift to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <date when="1829-10">October 1829</date> by his cousin,

                    Certainly, <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> was on a familiar footing 
                    with the family by <date when="1832-01">January 1832</date>, when he introduced the Ruskins to the writer, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php">James Hogg (<date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1835">ca. 1770&#x2013;1835</date>)</ref>.
