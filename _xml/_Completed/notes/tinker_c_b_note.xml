                <p><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was an influential teacher of eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century English literature at <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale University</orgName> from <date notBefore="1903" notAfter="1945">1903 to 1945</date>;

                    for a number of years beyond his retirement from teaching. A collector himself, <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> was known for his generosity 
                    in opening his personal library of manuscripts and rare books for students&#x02bc; use&#x2014;a generous trait he held in common 
                    with his friend and fellow collector, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName> (<date notBefore="1863" notAfter="1940">1863&#x2013;1940</date>)</ref>

                <p><persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName>, who had always been a zealous advocate for building the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> library&#x02bc;s collections, was just beginning his formal duties 
                    as keeper of rare books, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors and scholars on both sides of the <geogName corresp="#ATLANTIC">Atlantic</geogName> were surprised by the announcement of the

                    At <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, since the two <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sales coincided exactly with the completion the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling Memorial Library building</placeName> (<date notBefore="1927" notAfter="1931">1927&#x2013;31</date>), 
                    proposals for new rare book and manuscript acquisitions must have encountered stiff competition merely for the attention of library administrators, 
                    much less for available funding. The first <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> auction was held on <date when="1930-07-24">24 July 1930</date>, when the <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> staff had begun 
                    moving books to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling</placeName> stacks, a process initiated on <date when="1930-07-07">7 July 1930</date>. 
                    <persName corresp="#CBT">Tinker</persName> later wrote that he took up his post as keeper &#x201c;some four or five months before the opening of the new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STERLINGMEM">Sterling library</placeName>&#x201d;, 
                    but left unclear whether he referred to the months prior to the transfer of operations in the summer of <date when="1930">1930</date> 
                    or to the formal dedication of the building, which was held on <date when="1931-04-11">11 April 1931</date>&#x2014;or perhaps referencing the opening of the Rare Books Room, 
                    which was ready on <date when="1931-02-22">22 February 1931</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEOGHREPORT_1930-31">&#x201c;Report of the Librarian, July 1, 1930&#x2010;June 30, 1931&#x201d;</ref>, 3;

                    Whenever he assumed duties, the transition in responsibility may explain some of the obscurity surrounding how <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                    acquired certain items in the sale (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: The Buyers</ref>).</p>
                <!--MJF pick up here-->
                <p>Documentation remains to be uncovered to reconstruct fully by what agency Yale's acquisitions from the Sotheby's sales 
                    made their way to the library. Two important lots from the 1930 sale, Ruskin's juvenilia and his letters to his father, were bought 
                    probably by Hugh Allen, who was a son of Ruskin's publisher, George Allen, and who may have acted as an agent directly for Yale. 
                    Other lots from the 1930 sale were bought by an agent on the behalf of the Boston rare book dealer and Ruskin collector, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>)</ref>, 
                    who sold the lots to Yale in November 1930 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date>: The Buyers</ref>). 
                    Whatever the exact arrangements were, it seems unlikely that these important Ruskin investments would have been undertaken 
                    without his urging and involvement of Tinker.</p>

                <div type="section">
                <head type="section">Tinker and Ruskin Studies</head>
                
                <p>While Tinker's scholarship was centered in Boswell and Johnson studies--at least initially, until difficulties with access to manuscripts 
                    derailed his aspirations to continue editing Boswell's papers--Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites held an important place 
                    in his teaching, collecting, and writing. In 1908, Tinker published 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRSELECTIONSTINKER"><title type="anthology" corresp="#JRSELECTIONSTINKER"><hi rend="italic">Selections from the Works of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 
                    an anthology that he distanced from "such a volume as used to be entitled Elegant Extracts", instead reprinting chapters and lectures 
                    from Ruskin's works in as complete a form as practicable in order "to insure a correct notion of the general complexion" of the critic's ideas. 
                    For Tinker, Ruskin's thought and literary style constituted a unity, which must be studied as "one continuous development" (pp. iii, xii, xix). 
                    Such a position would have favored the acquisition of Ruskin's juvenilia and letters to his father, along with later manuscripts sampling the wide range 
                    of Ruskin's interests, that Yale gained from the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1930">1930</date></ref>.</p>
                
                <p>Tinker's personal collection of Ruskin included five autograph letters; and his rare and first-edition printed Ruskin, 
                    while not aspiring to comprehensiveness, ranged widely across Ruskin's interests and rhetorical styles 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#METZDORFTINKERLIBRARY"><persName corresp="RFMETZDORF">Metzdorf</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="METZDORFTINKERLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">The Tinker Library</hi></title></ref>, 371-74). 
                    He and his students had access, moreover, to a comprehensive Ruskin collection belonging to <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php">R. B. Adam</ref>, 
                    which Adam donated to Yale University Library in 1929, in friendship and in support of Tinker's tireless advocacy 
                    on behalf of the library's collections 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1"><persName corresp="#MHYDE">Hyde</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#HYDEADAMTINKERNEWTON1">&#x201C;Adam, Tinker, and Newton&#x201D;</title></ref>, 304). 
                    Equally beneficial to the library's Ruskin's holdings, if less happily in circumstances, the Boston book dealer 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="goodspeed_charles_note.php"><persName corresp="#CG">Charles E. Goodspeed</persName> (<date notBefore="1867" notAfter="1950">1867&#x2013;1950</date>)</ref> 
                    donated the manuscripts in his keeping, which had been damaged by his house fire in 1941. 
                    Tinker, at that time still keeper of rare books and manuscripts, was Goodspeed's correspondent during the salvage, 
                    and presumably Tinker helped oversee the care of the scorched items. A decade earlier, Goodspeed had served as the primary, 
                    though not the exclusive mediator for Yale's acquisitions from the Sotheby's Ruskin sales.</p>
