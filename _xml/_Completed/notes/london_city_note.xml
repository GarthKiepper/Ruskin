                <p>The <hi rend="italic">City</hi> is the &#x201C;general name for <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> within the gates and within the bars&#x201D;&#x2014;the 
                    gates marking the boundaries of the original city wall, and bars marking the extended boundaries beyond the wall, 
                    as areas were annexed to accommodate an expanding population who maintained the status of citizens of the city
                    (<persName corresp="#HBWHEATLEY">Wheatley</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="#WHEATLEYLONDON">London Past and Present</title>, 1:400&#x2013;401). By the late eighteenth century, the gates and bars had been removed&#x2014;except 
                    for Temple Bar, designed by Wren and erected after the Great Fire&#x2014;yet the City had acquired a distinct identity 
                    as &#x201C;an enclave within <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>&#x201D;. Within the sprawling metropolis, the City had become &#x201C;purely a place of business&#x201D;, 
                    &#x201C;the financial capital of the world&#x201D;, albeit not &#x201C;in itself the capital of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x201D; 
                    (Ackroyd, London, 519). Thus, in &#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 1&#x201D; (chap. 1), 
                    when Mamma mentions that Papa has gone to the &#x201C;city&#x201D;, she refers to this financial center,

                    <p>For <persName corresp="#WBESANT">Walter Besant</persName> writing at the end of the nineteenth century, 
                        the district of the City where <persName corresp="#JR">John James Ruskin</persName> worked was defined by the ancient boundaries of two gates, 
                        Aldgate in the east and <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BISHOPSGATE">Bishopsgate</placeName> on the north. Leadenhall Market marked one of the district&#x02BC;s oldest functions, 
                        while a more modern landmark was the headquarters of the <orgName corresp="#EASTINDIACO">East India Company</orgName>. The district also contained the Jewish quarter 
                        (<persName corresp="#WBESANT">Besant</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="#BESANTLONDONCITY">London City</title>, 146). In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, the <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#EASTINDIAHOUSE">East India House</placeName> was the <date when="1799">1799</date> neoclassical structure, 
                        featuring an Ionic portico; and in the year of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s birth, <persName corresp="#JMPHILOSOPHER">James Mill</persName> began his career in the building, 
                        with his son, <persName corresp="#JSM">John Stuart</persName>, starting work there as a clerk four years later 
                        (<persName corresp="#HBWHEATLEY">Wheatley</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="#WHEATLEYLONDON">London Past and Present</title>, 2:2&#x2013;3).</p>
                    <p>The business premises of <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</orgName> was located in <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName>, 
                        which runs between <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#LEADENHALLST">Leadenhall</placeName> and <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch</placeName> Streets. Once called a lane, 
                        <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName> is very old, its structures having escaped the
                        Great Fire. By the eighteenth century, observers regarded the street&#x02BC;s buildings as antiquated and &#x201C;mean&#x201D; 
                        except for those built in their own time in Billiter Square, on the west side of the street. 
                        Billiter Square was considered &#x201C;airy&#x201D; and lined with &#x201C;good new brick buildings, 
                        very well inhabited&#x201D;, according to eighteenth&#x2010;century sources quoted

                        those residences were gradually converted to businesses 
                        (<persName corresp="#PCUNNINGHAM">Cunningham</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book of London</hi>, 54; 
                        <persName corresp="#WBESANT">Besant</persName>, <hi rend="italic">London City</hi>, 150). 
                        One of these respectable buildings in <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Sreet</placeName> was owned by <persName corresp="#HT">Henry Telford</persName>, 
                        who became the sleeping partner in the firm of <orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</orgName>

                    <p>In the 1820s and 1830s, besides <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s firm, other import businesses were headquartered in the neighborhood, 
                        such as the large West India House, which operated the West India Docks 
                        (Chancellor, <hi rend="italic">Squares of London</hi> 385). For such companies, 
                        <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName> was convenient to the <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName>, which were situated east of the nearby <placeName corresp="#TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</placeName>. 
                        A more auspicious neighbor for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s career was the shop of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>, 
                        first located in <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#FENCHURCHST">Fenchurch Street</placeName>, around the corner from <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName>, 
                        where the company supplied stationery to the <orgName corresp="#EASTINDIACO">East India Company</orgName>, 
                        and later located in <placeName corresp="#CORNHILL">Cornhill</placeName>, where the company went on to develop its publishing arm 
                        (see <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company</orgName>).</p>

                        toward the end of the nineteenth century <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName> became &#x201C;very different&#x201D; 
                        with the erection of &#x201C;large and lofty piles of offices&#x201D; and &#x201C;a handsome avenue opened to Lime street&#x201D;, 
                        which runs parallel to <placeName type="BUILDING" corresp="#BILLITERST">Billiter Street</placeName> (<persName corresp="#HBWHEATLEY">Wheatley</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="WHEATLEYLONDON">London Past and Present</title>, 1:185).</p>

                        1] <!--Correction needed here?-->. By the 1820s, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was writing, 
                        new docks had been recently completed or were under construction to service the enormous increase in trade. 
                        Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, rapidly growing congestion at the quays had become untenable, 
                        causing damage to ships, and creating conditions of lax control that resulted in huge losses due to thievery and smuggling. 
                        Consequently, the legislative and engineering feat of constructing new wetdocks within the first decade of the nineteenth century was celebrated as a
                        testimonial to <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>&#x02BC;s commercial might (though the new docks would soon be made obsolete by growing size of ships powered by steam). 
                        To manage trade with <placeName corresp="#INDIA">India</placeName>, the new West India Docks were built in the Isle of Dogs, 
                        and the new East India docks arose at Blackwall. Closer to the City, 
                        the new <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName> were built at Wapping. As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was writing his first 
                        &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; volume, the St. Katherine Dock was under construction near the
                        Tower. It opened in <date when="1828">1828</date> (<persName corresp="#JMARRIOTT">Marriott</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="#MARRIOTTBEYONDTHETOWER">Beyond the Tower</title>, 96&#x2013;103).</p>
                    <p>Initially, <orgName corresp="RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford and Domecq</orgName> must have done business at the <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName> in
                        Wapping, opened in <date when="1805">1805</date>, since it held a twenty&#x2010;one&#x2010;year monopoly on imports of tobacco, rice, wine and brandy,
                        other than the Indies trade (a monopoly that backfired during the Napoleonic Wars, when imports of wine were disturbed). 
                        When the monopoly expired, and a free&#x2010;trade legislature was disinclined to renew it, 
                        the case made for the openly competitive St. Katherine Dock was led, among others, by wine merchants 
                        who complained that the <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London Docks</placeName> lacked adequate warehousing for the barrels that now crowded in shipments 
                        from the reopened Continent
                        (<persName corresp="#JGBROODBANK">Broodbank</persName>, <hi rend="italic">History of the Port of London</hi>, 1:114, 140, 157).</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JMARRIOTT">John Marriott</persName> comments that the <placeName corresp="#LONDONDKS">London docks</placeName>, &#x201C;more than any other feature of the industrial landscape&#x201D;, 
                        acquiried &#x201C;extraordinary symbolic power&#x201D; as representing &#x201C;metropolitan modernization&#x201D;, 
                        yet &#x201C;the vast body of casual labourers&#x201D; unsteadily employed there &#x201C;struck at the very heart of the social, moral and political 
                        concern exercising the minds of nineteenth&#x2010;century middle&#x2010;class observers in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, who . . . singled out the figure 
                        of the casual dockworker as the most degraded form of human existence&#x201D;
                        (<title type="BOOK" corresp="#MARRIOTTBEYONDTHETOWER">Beyond the Tower</title>, 104, 107).
                        In <title type="BOOK" corresp="#JRFORS">Fors Clavigera</title>, letter 12 (<date when="1871-12">December 1871</date>), 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps meant to invoke such an impression when referring to &#x201C;the men at St. Catherine&#x02BC;s Docks . . . under Tower Hill&#x201D;, 
                        who by implication rank among the lowest and most neglected of the &#x201C;host of earth&#x201D;. Perhaps this reference was also personal, 
                        meant to include his own family among the &#x201C;religious friends&#x201D; he mocks in the letter as claiming to &#x201C;&#x02BC;have nothing to do with it&#x2014;you 
                        are very sorry for it&#x2014;[but] . . . the power of England is coal&#x02BC;&#x201D;
                        (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="BOOK" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Works</title>, 27:206, 205, 204).
                    </p>
                    <!--<p>The appearance of warehouses was determined by &#x201C;requirements of structural
                        stability and fire protection,&#x201D; and remained consistent from the Great Fire of
                        the seventeenth century through the twentieth century. Materials were brick,
                        timber for floors, and tiles or slate for roofs, although cast iron was used for
                        columns and reinforcements from the early 1800s. Of interest for the Ruskin
                        firm, for wine and spirits at the London docks &#x201C;an important feature . . . was
                        the vaults . . . beneath quay level.&#x201D; These were wide barrel vaults resting on
                        stone or cast&#x2010;iron columns (Tucker, &#x201C;Warehouses in Dockland&#x201D; 22, 24, 26). </p>
                    <p>Transport from the city to the docks was at first by omnibus. River steamers were
                        in service by the mid&#x2010;1830s; and soon thereafter, rail lines, among the first in
                        the kingdom, ran to Greenwich and Blackwall (Pearsall, &#x201C;Dockland Transport&#x201D;
                        145&#x2013;46). For John James, the trip would not have been far from the premises of
                        Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq, which were housed in Billiter Street (see City of
                        London).</p>
                    <p>Shortly prior to these
                        developments, Thomas Pennant described Blackwall and Wapping as miles of
                        streets, &#x201C;inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men, alternate occupants of sea
                        and land: their floating tenements . . . before them. In fact, the whole river,
                        from the bridge, for a vast way, is covered with a double forest of masts, with
                        a narrow avenue in mid-channel&#x201D; (Pennant, <hi rend="italic">History of
                            London</hi> 2:56).</p>-->
