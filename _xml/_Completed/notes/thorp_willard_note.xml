                <p>Willard Thorp, professor of English at Princeton University, is significant to ERM because he was instrumential in establishing a research collection of Ruskin manuscripts, including juvenilia, 
                    at Princeton University Library in 1939. Ruskin collecting at Princeton mirrored that at Yale University Library, 
                    which was founded a decade earlier than Princeton's, in 1929-30.</p>
                
                <p>In collecting of Victorian printed works, Princeton and Yale reflected trends associated with 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.html">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>. 
                    Private collectors sought to compiled a comprehensive run of an author's first editions in their original condition, 
                    from juvenilia to last words--a goal that for Ruskin, Browning, Tennyson, and other major British nineteenth-century writers could entail hundreds of items. 
                    American institutions benefited by donations of such collections, Yale receiving a nearly complete Ruskin bequest in 1929 from 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php">R. B. Adam II (1863&#x2013;1940)</ref>. 
                    Princeton lacked a benefactor for Ruskin, but Thorp was able to persuade several collectors of other Victorian writers 
                    to contribute to Princeton Library's rare book holdings--particularly in the areas of poetry and fiction.</p>
                
                <p>First-edition hunters extended their collections with manuscripts, <hi rend="italic">alia</hi>, and--in Ruskin's case--drawings--as such items came available, 
                    and an extrordinary opportunity opened for Ruskin collectors on both sides of the Atlantic with the

                    These auctions made available the full chronological scope and diversity of Ruskin's manuscripts and drawings. 
                    Fortunately for American institutions, the Boston rare book and literary manuscript dealer,

                    who was himself a Ruskin collector, took advantage of the auctions with boldness and intelligence. 
                    Through Goodspeed, Yale was the beneficiary primarily of the 1930 sale, their acquisitions directed by

                    senior counterpart in the Yale English Department. Princeton acquired items from Goodspeed's purchases principally from from the 1931 sale.
                    While Yale and Princeton owe much to the respective individual energies of Tinker and Thorp, as institutions the universities also shared a context that encouraged

                    <head type="section">Thorp as Teacher and Collector</head>
                    
                    <p>Thorp ultimately built his scholarly reputation as an Americanist, but when these developments in Ruskin collecting were unfolding in the 1920s and 1930s 
                        Thorp was teaching British Victorian and modern poetry. With degrees in English from Hamilton College (B.A.) and Harvard University (M.A.), 
                        Thorp first taught at Smith College in 1921-24, and then came to Princeton in 1925 for a Ph.D. in English. 
                        He completed the degree in 1926 and joined the teaching staff of Princeton's English Department. Although his dissertation concerned realism in Elizabethan drama, 
                        he earned popularity as a teacher with a course on Victorian poetry. An early publication in this area--following 
                        his first major article, in PMLA for 1928, on stage adaptations of English Gothic fiction, which secured his assistant professorship--was a 1932 anthology of Victorian poets, 
                        <title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition, <date notBefore="1850" notAfter="1914">1850&#x2013;1914</date></hi></title>, 
                        which he edited along with his dissertation director, Thomas Marc Parrott, a scholar of Robert Browning as well as Shakespeare. 
                        By 1939, when he achieved the rank of associate professor, Thorp had begun turning his research and teaching to American literature, 
                        leading in 1940 to teaching Princeton's first graduate seminar in American studies (the Transcendentalists) and in 1941 to organizing 
                        the interdisciplinary American Civilization Program, the first interdepartmental program at Princeton 
                        (Robertson, "Remembering Professor Thorp", 128-29, 130-32). 
                        The year 1939, when Thorp organized donors for the Ruskin purchase, might therefore be regarded as the culmination of his Victorian interests.</p>
                    
                    <p>The anthology <title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition</hi></title> 
                        reflects a breadth of acquaintance with both major and lesser-known poets of the period; 
                        and while David A. Robertson recalls Thorp's classes in terms anticipating the practical criticism of I. A. Richards--Thorp 
                        would hand out mimeographed poems missing the poet's name and require students to write responses in direct engagement with the work, not the poet or period 
                        ("Remembering Professor Thorp", 129)--Thorp expected his students to survey writers and periods expansively. 
                        The anthology excludes writers "from whose work it was . . . impossible to gather a sufficient number 
                        of poems to furnish material for at least one conference or recitation" since "long experience in teaching has shown that little is to be gained 
                        by a class discussion of isolated specimens". And though the introduction declares from the outset that "there is no such thing as <hi rend="italic">poetry</hi>", 
                        "there are only poems", the anthology represents each of its poets in a well-rounded arc of development in order to tell its story 
                        "of the years of transition from Victorian reticence and respectability to the chaos of the War". In spite oF shared historical and intellectual trends, 
                        the "predominant trait" of the period, the editors believe, was "individualism" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><title type="book" corresp="#THORPPARROTTPOETRYOFTHETRANSITION"><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Transition</hi></title></ref>, ix-x, xxi-xxii). 
                        These convictions as a teacher guided Thorp as a collector in his drive to establish the Library's collection of Victorian poets--and, somewhat later, American writers--with 
                        no concessions to abridgement that would curtail students' research. The ambition was in sync with the phenomenon of biographically oriented first-edition collecting 
                        that overlapped with the period covered in Parrott and Thorp's anthology.</p>
                    
                    <p>BOver the years, Thorp became a noted collector and donor to Princeton University Library himself, 
                        and he lent his influence to attracting major collections to the librarythat did not necessarily pertain to his personal scholarship and teaching, 
                        such as the Morris L. Parrish collection of Victorian novels, 
                        and the F. Scott Fitzgerald collection 
                        (Wainwright, "One of the First and the Best"; Roche, "Willard Thorp", 322).</p>

                    <p>In 1930, when Yale acquired substantial Ruskin holdings from the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php"> <date when="1930">1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale</ref>, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#CBT">Chauncey Tinker</persName></ref>, 
                        was appointed keeper of rare books at the Sterling Library on the strength of his advocacy, like Thorp's, not only of building special collections but also of involving students in the use of archives. 
                        (At the time, Tinker also happened to be working on poetry, publishing <title type="book" corresp="#TINKERGOODESTATE"><hi rend="italic">The Good Estate of Poetry</hi></title> in 1929.) 
                        Thorp, who in 1930 was a young assistant professor, was asked by his dean to work with the newly formed 
                        <orgName corresp="#FPUL">Friends of the Princeton University Library</orgName>. To demonstrate its ambitions in practical terms, 
                        the organization published in each of the first several issues of its newsletter, <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title>, 
                        a list of "Desiderata" for the library needed by the departments. The first issue's wish-list reflected the passions of the popular new professor of Victorian poetry 
                        (and probably also his mentor, Parrott), 
                        consisting of "first editions" of Robert Browning. The list reflected the prevailing standard for collecting a run of "firsts" from early works to late, 
                        ranging from the youthful <title type="poem" corresp="#BROWNINGPAULINE">Pauline</title> of 1833 to a late publication of 1884 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" corresp="#DESIDERATAFPUL1"><title type="essay" corresp="#DESIDERATAFPUL1">"Desiderata"</title></ref>, 7). 
                        For the second issue of the newsletter, Thorp followed up with a "Desiderata" calling for 1200 titles by 400 Victorian poets. 
                        The estimated cost of the whole, minus the Browning firsts, was calculated at $3500 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" corresp="#DESIDERATAFPUL2"><title type="essay" corresp="#DESIDERATAFPUL2">"Desiderata"</title></ref>, 6).</p>
                    
                    <p>Thorp's two "Desiderata" represented the enigma confronting the library and its supporters. Before showy items for the Special Collections could be contemplated, 
                        the library needed to assemble a basic research-grade collection 
                        (see <ref type="note" target="provenance_american_research_libraries_note.php#PRINCETON">Ruskin Collecting by American Research Libraries in the Twentieth Century: Ruskin and the Building of Special Collections at Princeton University</ref>). 
                        In the third issue of <title type="periodical" corresp="#BIBLIAFPUL"><hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi></title>, the chair of English, 
                        <persName corresp="#DQB">Dickson Q. Brown</persName>, 
                        justified his faculty's call for "first editions of books of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries", 
                        especially "copies of obscurer writings . . . which can be had only in contemporary editions" from their respective periods, 
                        and "which are of the utmost significance because of the light . . . they throw on the tastes and interests of a bygone generation 
                        from which some great masterpiece has emerged". As it stood, even undergraduate English majors, when researching senior theses with a "zest" 
                        to discover "something which no one has known before", had to board a train for the Yale or Columbia university library 
                        to find basic materials for their projects ("Committee on Library Needs", 2, 4). 
                        To make the needs plain, this issue of Biblia concluded with a sixteen-page supplement identifying a "want-list" 
                        of hundreds of literary titles unavailable in the home university library. Given these needs, multiplied over many departments, 
                        Thorp later remembered that, "even by 1930, there was seldom anything left over" in the library budget 
                        "for a rare book or an important unpublished manuscript" to grace Special Collections 
                        (Thorp, "The First Twenty-five Years", 98).</p>
                    
                    <p>In 1939, therefore, in order to purchase the Ruskin manuscripts from Goodspeed, 
                        Thorp had to organize donors to raise the funds. With so many academic departments having submitted desiderata to Biblio throughout the decade--including 
                        the Department of Art and Archaeology, which was closely allied with the recently formed School of Architecture--perhaps 
                        the campaign was boosted by the interdisciplinary appeal of Ruskin. Ultimately, a portion of the purchase comprising six of Ruskin's sketchbooks and notebooks 
                        was housed in McCormick Hall, the campus art museum and home of Art, Archaeology, and Architecture, rather than in the Library Special Collections 
                        (Thorp, "The Ruskin Manuscripts", 2). Nonetheless, English faculty predominated among the donors to the Ruskin purchase were heavily represented by English faculty, 
                        and the campaign was led by Thorp along with another professor in English Department 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php#PRINCETON"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1931">1931</date>: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> and <orgName corresp="#PRINCETONLIBRARY">Princeton University Library</orgName></ref>). 
                        If interdisciplinary by nature of its materials, the Ruskin purchase can nonetheless be viewed as culminating the decade of collecting in Victorian literature 
                        that began with Thorp's bold call for a comprehensive collection of first editions by four hundred poets.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout the 1930s, Biblia records a steady flow of significant acquisitions by the Library in Victorian poetry. 
                        In 1933, the Library gained a comprehensive collection of Tennyson firsts, along with an R. L. Stevenson collection 
                        (Gerould, "The Henry Van Dyke Bequest"). From 1933 through 1938, a loyal donor, 
                        Francis H. Payne, was thanked for supplying funds to purchase Victorian poetry as well as for donating items from his own collection, 
                        including early editions by the Pre-Raphaelites, Coventry Patmore, Francis Thompson, and others. 
                        In 1937, Payne was tapped again for funds, this time to acquire English novels, 1750-1830, in support of "the establishment in the curriculum 
                        of a graduate course in prose fiction" ("Victorian Poets"; 
                        "Coventry Patmore"; "Victorian Poetry"; Thorp, "Two Special Collections", 6). Also in 1937, 
                        an Arthurian-themed collection brought firsts to the Library, mainly in Victorian poetry 
                        ("The Arthurian Legend"). Over time, even Thorp's initial call for Browning "firsts" was eventually realized, 
                        with the Library acquiring eight of the eleven items in the original wish list 
                        (Thorp, "The First Twenty-five Years", 103). Meanwhile, on the lookout for Victorian fiction, 
                        a 1933 account in Biblio--unsigned, but written in Thorp's florid and convivial style--about the opening of an exhibition 
                        of Morris Parrish's Trollope collection reads like an overture to the bequest of his entire Victorian fiction collection, 
                        which would finally be delivered in 1944.</p>
                    
                    <p>Judging only by the pages of Biblia, Thorp's success in attracting donors may have aroused jealousy, even in his own department. 
                        In 1936, on the occasion of the Library having acquired in 1935 some significant items in Milton studies, 
                        the Miltonist Maurice W. Kelley loftily declared that the Library "has yet to be given a single collection of any great English writer"--the 
                        acquisitions in Victorian studies over the previous five years apparently not qualifying for that distinction. 
                        Kelley pointedly remarked that "the works of John Milton . . . , which are of deep and vital interest to every heir 
                        of the great tradition of English speaking people, yet await the name of a donor", and he suggested that acquisitions 
                        for "other collections already started" should cease (Kelley, "John Milton Collection", 4). 
                        Undeterred, Thorp noting in the next issue of Biblia following Kelley's broadside 
                        that some resources dedicated to American studies had dried up, he insisted that 
                        "the Library must continue buying American literature" (Thorp, "Two Special Collections", 7). 
                        The foundation needed to be laid for an innovative program in American studies.</p>
