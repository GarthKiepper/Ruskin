                <head type="title">Eliza Orme (1848&#x2013;1937)</head>
                <p>Eliza Orme was a granddaughter of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="andrews_edward_note.php">the Reverend Edward Andrews (1786-1841)</ref>, 
                    Ruskin's first tutor and a celebrated Congregationalist preacher when the Ruskins attended Dissenting chapel. Eliza's mother was Andrews's eldest daughter, also named Eliza (1816-92); 
                    and her sister was Emily who married Coventry Patmore. In Praeterita, Ruskin mentions the sisters together, in connection with his tutoring, starting at age ten, by Dr. Andrews: 
                    "Miss Andrews, the eldest sister of the 'Angel in the House' [Emily Patmore], was an extremely beautiful girl of seventeen; she sang 'Tambourgi, Tambourgi' with great spirit 
                    and a rich voice, went at blackberry time on rambles with us at the Norwood Spa, and made me feel generally that there was something in girls that I did not understand, 
                    and that was curiously agreeable". As noted by the editors of the Library Edition, Eliza, as Mrs. Orme, held a salon, which was frequented by the Pre-Raphaelites (Works, 35:73-74, 74 n. 1). 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> copied verses entitled <title type="poem" corresp="#ANDREWSELIZABRAVEHUSSAR">&#x201C;The Brave Hussar&#x201D;</title> 
                    by Eliza, in <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msvi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title></ref>.</p>
                <p>The younger Eliza Orme earned a LLB from the University of London and was a practicing lawyer, as well as a feminist and writer on women's issues. Her relevance to <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> 
                    lies in her sharing volumes of her grandfather's magazine, the Spiritual Times, with H. Robertson Nicoll, enabling him to track down Ruskin's first publications (see 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php#REDISCOVERYBYNICOLL">"On Skiddaw and Derwent Water": <persName corresp="#HRN">Nicoll</persName>&#x02BC;s Discovery of the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi> Ruskin Publications</ref>) 
                    Since Orme was unmarried and lived with her parents until their death (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ORMEDNB"><persName corresp="#LHOWSAM">Howsam</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#ORMEDNB">&#x201C;Orme, Eliza (<date notBefore="1848" notAfter="1937">1848&#x2013;1937</date>)&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                    perhaps Eliza became aware of copies of her grandfather's magazine when her mother died in 1892. Nicoll published his findings in 1895.
