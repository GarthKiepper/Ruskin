                <p>On <date when="1930-07-24">24 July 1930</date>, <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby &#x0026; Co.</orgName> held an important sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s literary remains, 
                    described in the sale catalogue&#x02BC;s title as the 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>, Removed from His Residence, <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName>, and Sold with the Consent of <persName corresp="#AS">Arthur Severn</persName>, Esq., and of His Trustees</hi></title></ref>. 
                    This sale was perhaps the single most consequential event for the provenance of the early manuscripts.</p>

                        <p>The first 109 lots of the sale contained items from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s library, 
                            of which more than half (lots 24&#x2013;83) was devoted to the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">&#x201C;<persName corresp="#CKG">Kate Greenaway</persName> Collection from Brantwood&#x201D;</title>, 
                            while the remainder ranged from illuminated manuscripts and incunabula to modern first editions and presentation copies. 
                            <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> must have anticipated that the <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> would command interest, 
                            having devoted four of the six plates in the illustrated catalogue to drawings from her books, 
                            as compared with only two plates showing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts. 
                            The expectation was justified, as indicated by a copy of the sale catalogue at the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke Library</orgName> 
                            that was annotated by an observer. Almost every lot in <title type="archive" corresp="#GREENAWAYBRANTWOOD">Greenaway collection</title> found a buyer, 
                            with the highest price of &#x00A3;420 paid for a collection of autograph letters from <persName corresp="#CKG">Greenaway</persName> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Among the books unrelated to <persName corresp="#CKG">Greeanway</persName>, a copy of <persName corresp="#WBP">William Blake</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition of 
                            <persName corresp="#EY">Young</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#EYNIGHTTHOUGHTS"><hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi></title>,

                            Otherwise, according to the annotator of the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the 
                            <title type="catalogue" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930">sale catalogue</title>, the rare book and manuscript dealers <orgName corresp="#MAGGS">Maggs</orgName> and 
                            <orgName corresp="#MAGGS">Bernard Quaritch</orgName> acquired a few of the manuscript volumes and modern illustrated volumes, 
                            while other lots either were left unsold or their buyers unrecorded by the annotator. For example, the <orgName corresp="#BEINECKE">Beinecke</orgName> copy of the catalogue 
                            fails to note at least two items of incunabula as well as two lots of <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> novels that, 
                            according to <persName corresp="#JSD">James S. Dearden</persName>, were purchased by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="whitehouse_j_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName></ref>

                                                The catalogue describes the notebooks as a group: &#x201C;74&#x2013;84&#x2013;84 pp. containing geological, historical and grammatical notes, 
                                                half roan, 6 &#x00D7; 4 in.&#x201D; This summary of the contents credibly, if only roughly, corresponds to the Latin grammar, mineralogy, travel itineraries, and sermon drafts in fact 
                                                contained in these manuscripts. The material &#x201C;half roan&#x201D; is incorrect, however&#x2014;the notebooks being full roan, like the

                                                only very roughly approximates the 44 leaves, 42 leaves, and 43 leaves respectively found in them, as follows. The catalogue may afford a clue, however, that a

                            Curiously, in what appears to be the earliest published report describing acquisitions by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> 
                            from the <date when="1930-07">July 1930</date> <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale, the items sold to the library by <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> 
                            are not mentioned. Instead, in a detailed <date when="1931-01">January 1931</date> report in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE">Yale University Library Gazette</title>, 
                            it was lots 110 and 112, the six bound volumes of Ruskin family letters and the six slipcases containing juvenilia, that are celebrated as forming 
                            &#x201C;a considerable portion of the <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> collection of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts&#x201D; that is &#x201c;now preserved for all time against sale and spoliation&#x201d;

                            These two lots are not included in the documentation of <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s <date when="1930-11">November 1930</date> transfer of <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02bc;s sale items to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>, 
                            nor are the items that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> did definitely sell to <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> in <date when="1930">1930</date> mentioned in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE">Gazette</title> article. 
                            It is possible that, within the &#x201c;considerable portion of the <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> collection&#x201d;, the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE">Gazette</title> writer meant also to comprise 
                            the items acquired from <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, but that he focused on lots 110 and 112 because they stood out from the rest, set apart not only by their contents relating to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth, 
                            but also by their striking blue&#x2010;morocco casings. Still, the focus on &#x201c;this noteworthy group&#x201d; of juvenilia and letters&#x2014;represented 
                            in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#YALEGAZETTE">Gazette</title> as &#x201c;an impressive addition to the Library&#x02bc;s collection of Ruskiniana&#x201d;, which was already grounded

                            the successful bids for lots 110 and 112 were placed by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">&#x201C;Allen&#x201D;</persName> (lot 110, &#x00A3;520; lot 112, &#x00A3;260).

                            Beyond the initial purchase of lots 110 and 112 by <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName>, however, the details of the manuscripts&#x02BC; journey

                            &#x201C;purchased by Mr. <persName corresp="#CG">Charles Goodspeed</persName>&#x201D; when they were auctioned &#x201C;en bloc at <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName>&#x02BC;s&#x201D;, 
                            and &#x201C;in turn&#x201d; these items were &#x201c;purchased by <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName>&#x201D;. It seems odd that <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> 
                            would have commissioned two agents at the sale&#x2014;<persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName>, as well as Stevens and Brown&#x2014;unless, for some reason, <persName corresp="#ALLENH">Allen</persName> acted in concert <!--MJF pick up here-->
                            with <!--Stevens and Brown as individuals not found in crib. -->Stevens and Brown to obtain these two particular lots. Adding to the confusion, <persName corresp="#CBHOGAN">Hogan</persName> says that the volumes of letters (lot 110) &#x201C;were purchased by 
                            <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> at the <orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby</orgName> auction of <date when="1930-07-24">July 24, 1930</date>&#x201D;--a 
                            vague statement, suggesting either that <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale</orgName> did not transact through <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> for lot 110, 
                            or that Goodspeed's mediation is to be taken for granted by the reader. The latter assumption should have been forestalled 
                            by a footnote specifying that "other items that came from Brantwood, through Sotheby and Goodspeed" have been "marked 
                            with an asterisk". Hogan does not attach an asterisk to "the magnificent assemblage of Ruskin's letters" at Yale, 
                            leading one to the conclusion that Yale acquired the letters, lot 110, directly through the agency of Hugh Allen, 
                            while lot 112 came roundabout to Yale, from Allen to Goodspeed to the university library

                            In the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KEOGHREPORT_1930-31">"Report of the Librarian, July 1, 1930-June 30, 1931"</ref>, 
                            published 1 April 1932, the purchase of "a large mass of Ruskin material" 
                            is reported, listing "letters written by him to his father" (but not the juvenilia) along with the items that formed the Goodspeed purchase. 
                            Perhaps the obscurity surrounding these purchases must simply be put down their having been overshadowed by 
                            "the great event of the year--the greatest since the founding of the Library"--which is announced at start of this issue of the 
                            "Report of the Librarian" as "the transfer of the books and of the functions of the Library to the Sterling Memorial building (pp. 8, 3).</p>

                            took up his post as keeper of rare books for the libary in addition to his professorial appointment in the English Department. 
                            While his name does not appear in connection with Yale's boon from the 1930 Sotheby's sale, 
                            Tinker is likely to have taken a keen interest in the Ruskin materials, and perhaps advised about their acquisition, whether or not he had an active role. 
                            Sources differ whether Tinker was appointed keeper of rare books at Yale University Library in 1930 or 1931, 
                            but he had long been an advocate for building up the library's collection, and he was a legendary teacher 
                            of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature--including Ruskin, whom he treated as a thinker, and not just a fine stylist. 
                            Tinker was also known for giving students access to manuscripts and rare books from his extensive personal collection, 
                            which included Ruskin; and he was aware of the extent and interest of Ruskin's bibliographical history. 
                            In 1929, the year prior to the Sotheby's sale, Tinker's close friend and fellow collector,

                            donated his meticulously curated Ruskin collection to Yale; and it is notable how felicitously lots 110 and 112, 
                            the letters and juvenilia, complement Adam's bequest, which includes the run of early poems published in annuals

                            Ruskin's intentions for his estate as stated in his will, implying that the Severn family may have acted in bad faith
