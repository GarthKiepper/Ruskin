                <head>Janet ("Jessie") Richardson (1783-1828)</head>
                <p>John Ruskin's aunt, sister of John James Ruskin, married in 1804 to <!-- ref note -->Patrick Richardson (1774-1824) of Perth, Scotland. 
                    She was the mother of ten children. By the time Jessie herself died on 18 May 1828, six of the ten children had also died, 
                    including her namesake <!-- ref note -->Janet ("Jessie", 1820-27) and <!-- ref note -->James (1808-26). Jessie, near to John Ruskin in age, was a playmate 
                    when the Ruskins visited the family in Perth; and James was an older youth, to whom Ruskin looked up in boyhood, when James resided at Herne Hill. 
                    In Praeterita, Ruskin frames his account of his aunt in terms of child deaths
                    (Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:xlviii-xlix, 8 n. 1; Viljoen, Ruskin's Scottish Heritage, 183, 185, 157; 
                    Ruskin, Works, 35:65).
                </p>
                <p>When Jessie died on 18 May, the Ruskins were embarked on the <!-- ref note -->Tour of 1828, 
                    where they received the news of her death on 24 May. John James acted immediately to make arrangements for the now orphaned, surviving children 
                    of Jessie and Patrick--the sons John Ruskin Richardson (1807-74), <!-- ref note -->William Richardson (1811-75), 
                    and Andrew Richardson (b. 1817); and the daughter <!-- ref note -->Mary Richardson (1815-49). 
                    John James was one of five trustees of a settlement by Jessie's husband, Patrick 
                    (Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:197-98 n. 1). 
                    John James's household accounts show that, before 1828, he had already been supporting Mary's and William's educations, as well as sending 
                    money to his sister. In 1828 the headings of the expense lists for family charity change from "Mrs Richardson my Sister at Perth" to 
                    "John, Mary, And<hi rend="superscript">w</hi> &#x0026; Will<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Richardson" in 1829, 
                    and then to "Mary, Will<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> &#x0026; And<hi rend="superscript">w</hi> Richardson" in 1830--John Ruskin Richardson 
                    being old enough, by that time, to be self-supporting, although John James probably continued to lend support by helping him break into the wine business
                    (Burd, ed. Ruskin Family Letters, 1:14-15 n. 3; John James Ruskin, Account Book [1827-45], 4v, 13v, 18r, 23r)</p>
