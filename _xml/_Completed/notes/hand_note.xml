                    <p>For a substantial period of the early Ruskin manuscripts, the most distinctive handwriting of the three Ruskins 
                        belonged to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, whereas the more closely related hands&#x2014;close 
                        enough to be easily confused with one another, by the modern researcher&#x2014;were <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s. From <date when="1827">1827</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began writing cursive in ink, 
                        and well into the <date notBefore="1830-01-01" notAfter="1839-12-31">1830s</date>, the mother&#x02bc;s and son&#x02bc;s cursive scripts appear similar, with many of the characters formed on the same or similar pattern. 
                        However, in a <date when="1903">1903</date> essay,

                                <p>[<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] developed his own writing like other precocious boys and girls, though there is some trace of teaching 
                                    at the very start. But after <date when="1830">1830</date> he exchanged, perhaps at the instance of superior orders, his &#x201c;print&#x201d; 
                                    for copperplate; the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x201c;Iteriad&#x201d;</title></ref>

                                    coming in, and all his letters to the old&#x2010;fashioned business man show the obvious desire to please.

                                    free&#x2010;and&#x2010;easy wording contrasts quite ludicrously with the formal writing.</p>

While it is true that, in the <date notBefore="1830-01-01" notAfter="1839-12-31">1830s</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> employed a &#x201c;copperplate&#x201d; cursive 
                        for his fair&#x2010;copy poems and some letters addressed to his father, his everyday cursive, such as that 
                        used for drafting poems, was not a &#x201c;commercial&#x201d; round hand like his father&#x02bc;s.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> seems to recognize this difference, but he sweeps the facts pell&#x2010;mell into a character study based on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s hand, 
                        which he summarizes as &#x201c;chamelion&#x201d;: &#x201c;For his mother he had another hand; for his friends and for himself an assortment of varying scribbles. 
                        But there, I think, comes out one of the leading points in his character. To be a man of strong thought and will, innovator in art, science, politics, 
                        morality, and religion, there never was such a chameleon, always ready to colour his mind after his surroundings; all things to all men&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLINGWOODRUSKINSHAND">Collingwood, <title type="essay" corresp="WGCRUSKINSHAND">&#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Hand&#x201D;</title>, <title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title></ref>, 652; 
                        reprinted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINRELICS">Collingwood, <title type="book" corresp="#WGCRUSKINRELICS"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Relics</hi></title></ref>, 141&#x2013;42). 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> originally wrote the essay for <title type="periodical" corresp="#GOODWORDS"><hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi></title>, 
                        a nondenominational <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> magazine with Scottish connections. His observation about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s chamelion character was itself colored, perhaps, 
                        by the magazine&#x02bc;s ecumenical mission, which sought to enliven the dullness of English Sabbatarianism 
                        by extending the boundaries of Sunday devotional reading to include <orgName corresp="#CHRISTIANITY">Christian</orgName> thought in secular genres, especially poetry 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EHNESGOODWORDS"><persName corresp="#CEHNES">Ehnes</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#EHNESGOODWORDS">&#x201C;Religion, Readership, and the Periodical Press&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        Studied apart from such a script&#x2014;and putting aside, also, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s tendency to assume that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s sole significant 
                        audience in boyhood was his father&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ordinary youthful cursive script appears consistent, not &#x201c;an assortment of varying scribbles&#x201d;, 
                        and its influences can be found as much in his mother&#x02bc;s hand as in his father&#x02bc;s.</p>
                    
                    <p>Compared to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02bc;s, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s hand is flamboyantly larger, more slanted, and its characters accentuated 
                        with long ascenders and descenders. Capital letters are frequent. (The contrast is vivid in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, version of 
                        <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msia_g1.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        to which both <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> contributed fair copy.) 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early cursive hand resembles his mother's, which is smaller, 
                        more upright, and less exaggerated in the ascenders and descenders of characters. It is understandable that a home&#x2010;schooled youth 
                        would initially imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                        from which the father was absent for protracted periods. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> was, after all, 
                        the most constant daily influence on <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s early education, 
                        including his penmanship. What does merit attention in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s analysis 
                        is the formality and variety of styles that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used for his fair copies, 
                        both print and cursive. He modeled these styles on examples in copybooks as well as on typography he found in books.</p>
                    
                    <p>Like many Victorian children, including the Bront&#x00EB;s, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitated typeface from the start of his surviving manuscripts. 
                        The influence of copybooks appears at a particular juncture in the development of his handwriting, 
                        the auspicious adoption of pen and ink in place of pencil in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#RUSKINSHANDEARLYPRINTINK">Early Print Lettering and Cursive in Ink</ref>),
                        at which point <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> purchased a copybook&#x2014;&#x201c;Writing Butterworth 7/6&#x201d;, according to his accounts&#x2014;a text identified by

                        The manual was produced by the firm of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="butterworth_e_note.php"><persName corresp="#EDB">Edmund Butterworth</persName> (d. <date when="1814">1814</date>)</ref>, 
                        who had held the post of writing master and accountant at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Royal High School</orgName>, <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, 
                        until <date when="1793">1793</date>, shortly before <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> enrolled at that institution in <date when="1795">1795</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Apparently, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> regarded this juncture in the development of his son&#x02bc;s handwriting as a coming of age, 
                        analogous to his own. When <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> enrolled at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> at age ten, 
                        he was already somewhat older than his class, the customary starting age being eight&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02bc;s age when first using a pen. 
                        Scottish burgh schools like the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName> in theory championed a democratic ideal 
                        of seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, and fees were kept moderate. Nonetheless, the Ruskin family 
                        may have needed extra time to scrape together the means even for moderate fees, or <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02bc;s mother, <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>, 
                        may have been apprehensive of exposing him to a famously sadistic Latin master 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi></title></ref>, 59&#x2013;62;

                        Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <date when="1827">1827</date>, at age eight,

                    Even at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh Royal High</orgName>, the writing and arithmetic classes had always been optional, the expectation being that many youths would acquire these accomplishments

                    <p>As a path to self&#x2010;cultivation, copybooks typically provided instructional texts (set in letterpress) along with illustrations of writing samples in various styles or <hi rend="italic">hands</hi> 
                        (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences,

                        round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces

                        In the eighteenth century, round hand settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                        In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely

                        was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>&#x201D;, in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;

                    such as works by the French artists <persName corresp="#JSC">Jean Sim&#x00E9;on Chardin</persName> (<date notBefore="1699" notAfter="1779">1699&#x2013;1779</date>),

                    who were concerned with conveying progressive educational ideas and with representing children as thoughtful, individualistic observers 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOHNSONPICTURINGPEDAGOGY"><persName corresp="#DJOHNSON">Johnson</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#JOHNSONPICTURINGPEDAGOGY">&#x201C;Picturing Pedagogy&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based his print lettering in part on models found in his favorite books. For example, in his adaptation of 
                    <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS"><hi rend="italic">Early Lessons</hi></title>,

                    he imitated the original&#x02BC;s title page; and his lettering generally suggests the influence of English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer,  
                    and their predecessor, Caslon, which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
                    Even in these first manuscripts, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, however, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also flourished his lettering with decorative capitals that 
                    in the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1829-12-31">1828&#x2013;29</date> <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol3_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3</title></ref>, 
                    he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. 
                    The style of this lettering appears based on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the <date notBefore="1780" notAfter="1789">1780</date>s 
                    and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century

                    One likely model for his &#x201C;double&#x201D; lettering was the largest, most prominent labeling used for maps in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s geography book,

                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> 
                    provide a reliable guide. In <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                    and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                    also witnessed the mass production of steel pens, and by <date when="1838">1838</date> this output increased to 220 million. Also by the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                    manufacturers were perfecting quill nibs for use in pen holders, 
                    and improvements in quill fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                    <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                    consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                    preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one

                <p>  Yet when learning to handle pen and ink, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declared, according to his mother,

                    Examples of these first efforts from around <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> include <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05">May 1827 letter</title></ref> accompanying

                    (not the poem itself, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copied in print lettering rather than cursive, albeit using a pen). An early example of cursive applied to a poem is found in
