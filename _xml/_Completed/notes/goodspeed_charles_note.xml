                <p><persName corresp="#CG">Charles Eliot Goodspeed</persName> was significant both as a personal collector of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and as a seller to other <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors, 
                    operating from his shop in <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston, Massachusetts</placeName>, first opened in <date when="1898">1898</date> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED"><persName corresp="WMWHITEHILL">Whitehill</persName>, <title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED">&#x201c;Charles Eliot Goodspeed&#x201d;</title></ref>, 261). 
                    In his memoir, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref> (<date when="1937">1937</date>), <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> dates his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collecting from his youth in the <date notBefore="1880" notAfter="1889">1880s</date>, 
                    giving two reasons for &#x201c;the spell of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x201d;. First, his books occupied, &#x201c;if not the highest, at least high rank in modern English literature&#x201d;, 
                    for &#x201c;although his style is criticised&#x201d;, he &#x201c;is conceded to be a great prose writer&#x201d;. Second, for collectors, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books presented outstanding 
                    &#x201c;examples of book&#x2010;making&#x201d;, excelling &#x201c;principally in illustration&#x201d; but also in the &#x201c;minute attention&#x201d; that the author gave to all aspects 
                    of book&#x2010;making in such works as &#x201c;<title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRDEUCALION">Deucalion</title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPROSERPINA">Proserpina</title>, and the other books issued [originally] in parts&#x201d; (pp. 263, 264). 
                    It was perhaps the bibliophile&#x02bc;s enchantment with the illustrations in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s books that caused <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> to take a special interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s own drawings.</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s standard for &#x201c;book&#x2010;making&#x201d; inspired <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> also as a publisher. In the <date when="1939">1939</date> edition of 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#LEHMANNHAUPTBOOKINAMERICA"><title type="book" corresp="#LEHMANNHAUPTBOOKINAMERICA"><hi rend="italic">The Book in America</hi></title></ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#HLH">Hellmut Lehmann&#x2010;Haupt</persName> characterized <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> as &#x201c;a disciple of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, and moved by many interests which he shared with the <orgName corresp="#STONEKIMBALL">Stone and Kimball</orgName> generation&#x201d; (p. 254), 
                    referring to the small art&#x2010;nouveau publishers of the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date>, such as <orgName corresp="#STONEKIMBALL">Stone &#x0026; Kimball</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#CHICAGO">Chicago</placeName> and 
                    <orgName corresp="#COPELANDDAY">Copeland &#x0026; Day</orgName> in <placeName corresp="#BOSTON">Boston</placeName>. These publishers, according to <persName corresp="#HLH">Lehmann&#x2010;Haupt</persName>, &#x201c;had in common their determination 
                    to publish only works of literary quality and to bring out their selections in an attractive and distinctive format&#x201d; (p. 211). 
                    From the founding of his bookselling business through the early <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1935">1930s</date>, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> realized these art&#x2010;book ambitions in small publishing projects of his own, 
                    which were printed by the <orgName corresp="#MERRYMOUNTPRESS">Merrymount Press</orgName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MAHONEYGOODSPEED"><persName corresp="#MMAHONEY">Mahoney</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#MAHONEYGOODSPEED">&#x201c;C.

                <p>The spell of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was not confined to bibliographical appeal, however. <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> was a thorough and admiring student of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s ideas, 
                    as demonstrated by the scholarship he brought to a not insignificant bibliographical contribution to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies in the <date notBefore="1930" notAfter="1939">1930s</date>, his 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDCAT"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings, and Manuscripts by John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 
                    published by <orgName corresp="#GOODSPEEDSBOOKSHOP">Goodspeed&#x02BC;s Book Shop</orgName> 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php#BUYERS"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library, <date when="1931">1931</date>: The Buyers</ref>). 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s approach to thinking through <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have been primarily biographical. 
                    His most cherished collector&#x02bc;s possession was the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>; 
                    and according to a record of a talk he gave at <orgName corresp="#WELLESLEYC">Wellesley College</orgName> Library in <date when="1933">1933</date>, 
                    he concentrated on &#x201c;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s youth&#x201d; and &#x201c;his love in later life for <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose La Touche</persName>&#x201d;, 
                    illustrating the talk with &#x201c;his own collection of early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings and other material illustrative of his life&#x201d;, 
                    including <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s portrait drawing of <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose La Touche</persName>, and one of <persName corresp="#GR">George Richmond</persName>&#x02bc;s portrait drawings of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                    marriage with <persName corresp="#ECG">Euphemia Gray</persName>&#x201d; (p. 268).</p>
                
                <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> also took a practical interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>: as <persName corresp="#WMWHITEHILL">Walter Muir Whitehill</persName> remarks about the bookseller&#x02bc;s retirement years, 
                    <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> pursued interests sponsored by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s works, such as tending to rare, wild plant species in his woodland garden 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED"><title type="dictionary_entry" corresp="#WHITEHILLGOODSPEED">&#x201c;Charles Eliot Goodspeed&#x201d;</title></ref>, 361). His most regretted loss at the final <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName> estate sale in <date when="1931-07">July 1931</date> was <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s 
                    mineral cabinet, an &#x201c;item [that] excited me greatly, for it revived my early interest in mineralogical specimens, never entirely lost&#x201d;

                    <head type="section"><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> and the New England Ruskin Collecting Community</head>
                    
                    <p>As one of most prominent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collectors stateside in the first half of the twentieth century, 
                        <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> exhibited characteristics of the trend for 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.html">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</ref>, 
                        which committed collectors to assembling comprehensive runs of an author&#x02bc;s first editions in their original condition. 
                        In his memoir, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> comments on his &#x201c;mistake&#x201d; as a young collector in causing his fledgling <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection to be uniformly rebound, 
                        instead of preserving the items in their original state. He therefore disposed of that false start and rebuilt his <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection 
                        on &#x201c;the primary rule that pamphlet issues of all kinds, if intended for sale to collectors, 
                        must be preserved in their original form&#x201d;. Eventually, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection reached over five hundred items 
                        of first editions along with &#x201c;all the authorized editions of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his biographies&#x201d; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref>, 261&#x2013;62, 265). 
                        The volume count is comparable in scope with a contemporaneous comprehensive <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collection assembled by the American collector, 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName> (<date notBefore="1863" notAfter="1940">1863&#x2013;1940</date>)</ref> 
                        and his father by adoption, <persName corresp="#RBAI">Robert Borthwick Adam I</persName> (<date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1904">1833&#x2013;1904</date>).</p>
                    
                    <p>As a bookseller as well as collector, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> held to the standard of &#x201c;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> firsts&#x201d;, 
                        of which he believed he &#x201c;bought more . . . abroad than any other American dealer&#x201d;. As a <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> specialist, 
                        he distinguished his shop from the &#x201c;larger booksellers&#x201d;, who could be counted on to stock 
                        &#x201c;the nine&#x2010;volume set comprising <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS">Modern Painters</title>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRSEVENLAMPS">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</title>, and <title type="book" corresp="#JRSTONESOFVENICE">The Stones of Venice</title>&#x201d; 
                        in a uniform size with illustrations&#x2014;the latter caveat obscuring what the initiated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> collector would recognize, 
                        that these sets were made up with later editions of <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters I</hi></title> and <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS2"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters II</hi></title> rather than the first editions, 
                        not because the firsts were a different size than the other volumes, but because the firsts were extremely rare. 
                        Scouring <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> firsts, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> says that, other than the prized <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi> I</title> and <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS2">II</title> and 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> (<date when="1850">1850</date>) by J.R.</ref>, 
                        he &#x201c;found no competition&#x201d; for first editions of lesser&#x2010;known <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> titles&#x2014;the dozens of books and pamphlets beyond 
                        nine&#x2010;volume sets &#x2014;always on the shelves of the larger booksellers&#x201c; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><title type="book" corresp="#GOODSPEEDYANKEEBOOKSELLER"><hi rend="italic">Yankee Bookseller</hi></title></ref>, 262&#x2013;63). 
                        The alertness for early and late <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> titles appears to have marked <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>&#x02bc;s strategy as a buyer and seller, 
                        not only for print but also for manuscripts. His knowledge about the full scope of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s writing and bibliography 
                        probably made him unique among American dealers, and certainly the single most influential force in the provenance of manuscripts constituting <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> credited the influence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s American friend and <orgName corresp="#HARVARD">Harvard</orgName> professor of the history of art,

                        for the "mild local interest in Ruskin then prevalent" in the first third of the twentieth century, 
                        and he believed his own "earnestness" contributed to upholding the "fading Ruskin tradition" at least in New England. 
                        (He hoped that the chapter on Ruskin in his memoir would "arouse a new interest in Ruskin, at least with collectors", 
                        when the author had become so "strangely neglected today".) While he knew the Ruskin collector R. B. Adam only by reputation, not as a client, 
                        Goodspeed supplied other important American collectors, including 
                        <persName corresp="#CT">Caleb Benjamin Tillinghast</persName> (1843-1909), 
                        librarian of the Massachusetts State Library; and John G. Winant (1889-1947), 
                        governor of New Hampshire and ambassador to the United Kingdom  
                        (Yankee Bookseller, 262, 264-65; and see

                    <p>In 1920-21, Goodspeed donated his personal Ruskin collection to Wellesley College, "in consideration of Ruskin's interest in the education of girls

                        Along with the print holdings, the collection included Ruskin drawings, proofs of engravings touched by Ruskin, marked printer proofs, 
                        and other unique items (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WELLESLEYPRESREPORT_1919-21">Wellesley College, "Annual Reports . . . 1919-21"</ref>, 45-46). 
                        Goodspeed continued to contribute to the collection from the 1920s through the 1940s, the collection presently totaling nearly nine hundred items.</p>

                    <p>As a Boston dealer, Goodspeed was well positioned to acquire Ruskin rarities connected with the region--for example, 
                        acquisitions from the estate of Ruskin's friend, <persName corresp="#FALEXANDER">Francesca Alexander</persName>, which he gave to Wellesley. 
                        The thoughtful variety and scope of his collection when donated to Wellesley shows, however, that he had long searched beyond used book trading 
                        to build up his holdings. His most significant opportunity to contibute stateside to Ruskin archives came in 1930-31, 
                        when he played a highly competitive role in the

                    <p>Goodspeed's strategy as a buyer in these sales of manuscripts and drawings appears to have corresponded to his approach as a dealer 
                        in printed Ruskin items--that is, to seize on what was then considered non-canonical Ruskin, 
                        for which competition could be expected to be less keen. (His agent at these sales, the London firm, B. F. Stevens &#x0026; Brown, 
                        assured their other major Ruskin client, W. H. Whitehouse, that the firm could work with mutual advantage for both Goodspeed and Whitehouse.<!-- SOURCE -->) 
                        It seems likely, however, that, while avoiding squaring off against competitors for the canonical 
                        Ruskin manuscripts like Whitehouse, Goodspeed took on considerable risk. Not only had the Great Depression begun in America, 
                        but, even before the crash, interest in Ruskin was declining. In 1929, R. B. Adam had donated his Ruskin collection to Yale, 
                        after unsuccessfully attempting for six years to sell the collection through the major New York dealer, A. S. W. Rosenbach 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="adam_r_b_note.php"><persName corresp="#RBA">R. B. Adam II</persName> [1863-1940]</ref>).</p>

                        A quotation of items from the 1931 manuscript sale on file at the Beinecke Library suggests that Goodspeed 
                        offered first chance at these items to Yale, but the library purchased only two items
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php#YALE1931"><orgName corresp="#SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</orgName> Sale of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Manuscripts and Library: <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName>, the 1931 Acquisitions, and <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName></ref>. 
                        He then compiled the offerings in the scholarly and elegantly produced <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDCAT"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#GOODSPEEDCAT"><hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings, and Manuscripts by John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 
                        which must have entailed a significant expense in itself. One recipient of the catalogue in 1932<!-- CHECK --> was <persName corresp="#JHW">J. H. Whitehouse</persName>, 
                        whom Goodspeed hoped to interest especially in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drawings, though <persName corresp="#JHW">Whitehouse</persName> 
                        is believed to have delayed acquiring a group of these drawings until <date when="1936">1936</date> (RBB 138&#x2013;39). 
                        In Yankee Bookseller, published in 1937, Goodspeed's 
                        observation of declining interest in Ruskin, and his bid to revive interest at least among collectors, 
                        must have been prompted by the slowing sales of his Sotheby's acquisitions. Not until 1939 were many of the items in Goodspeed's

                        Salvaging viable remains of books and manuscripts from the catastrophe, <persName corresp="#CG">Goodspeed</persName> donated 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts to <orgName corresp="#YALEUNIVLIBRARY">Yale University Library</orgName> in the hope that they could be preserved in spite of damage. 
                        He chose the Sterling Library because "it was his wish to complete Yale's holdings of the available major Ruskin manuscripts, 
                        so many of which had passed through his hands on their way to New Haven"

                    <p>The first of these gifts, sent soon after the fire in <date when="1941-03">March 1941</date>, was the manuscript of <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title>, 
                        which he had kept for himself from the 1930

                        Before the fire, in Yankee Bookseller, he confessed: "It is for the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> 
                        that I have most regard. I had bought . . . [the autobiography] when published in periodical form, looking forward to each succeeding number 
                        with a keener interest than the modern reader would have for the weekly installment of a story by Agatha Christie 
                        in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Post</hi>. . . . I cannot imagine a temptation sufficent to make me part with Ruskin's portrait of Rose La Touche 
                        and his manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>" (Yankee Bookseller, 269). When that time did come, 
                        not as a temptation, but as an unthinkable catastrophe, Goodspeed was devastated with remorse. Writing to 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="tinker_c_b_note.php">Chauncey B. Tinker (1876-1963)</ref>, the keeper of rare books at Yale University Library, 
                        whether he would "care to be bothered with material in such damaged condition", Goodspeed thought it "fitting that what is left of it should be preserved there. . . . 
                        I myself do not feel like putting it in shape for better preservation. . . . 
                        I hardly need to say how keenly I regret that, as the custodian of a manuscript of this kind, I have been so negligent in properly caring for it. 
                        We think of these things, however, when it is too late". In a subsequent letter, Goodspeed rejoiced in having recovered more of the manuscript, 
                        but two octavo volumes had perished altogether 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDALSBEINECKEPRAETERITA"><title type="letter" corresp="#goodspeed_to_tinker_1941-03-25">Goodspeed to Tinker, 25 March 1941</title> and <title type="letter" corresp="#goodspeed_to_tinker_1941-03-31">31 March 1941</title></ref>).</p>
