                <p>John Ruskin&#x02BC;s uncle by marriage to <!-- ref note -->Janet ("Jessie") Richardson, sister of John James Ruskin. 
                    The family lived in Perth, Scotland. Patrick died on 20 July 1824, when the Ruskins' journeys to Perth were a nearly annual feature of Ruskin's boyhood 
                    (see Tours of 1822-24; Tours of 1826-27; for Patrick's life dates, 
                    see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SCOTTISHHERITAGE">Viljoen, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi></ref>, 182, 185).</p>
                
                <p>Patrick&#x02BC;s profession, tanning, was among the trades on the move in <!-- ref note -->Perth, 
                    a self&#x2010;styled progressive and modernizing city. 
                    Allegedly, Patrick was boastful and exaggerated his wealth, however; and 
                    according to a canceled passage of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>,<!-- DCH, 35:409; check my transcript --> his death in 1824 
                    left his wife and children with only &#x201C;a moderate independence, and six children, with whom, leaving the large house and 
                    river&#x2010;bank garden of Bridge End, she crossed the Tay to Rose Terrace&#x201D; (Ruskin, Works, 35:409; 
                    see Viljoen, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi> 73&#x02013;74). The impression of Patrick's extravagance is confirmed 
                    by John James's household accounts, which document his financial support to Jessie and her children after Patrick's death 
                    (John James Ruskin, Account Book [1827-45]). Van Akin Burd finds that, in 1818, Patrick paid only the interest on the purchase of the Bridge End house, 
                    which in April 1826 was transferred to the trustees of the estate and sold the following month
