                <p>Omitted from this list are the drawings that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made to illustrate <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                    which occupied his creative energy for about a year following the family&#x02BC;s return in <date when="1833-08">September 1833</date> (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>). 
                    The illustrations are annotated separately as part of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s edition of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. The tour sketches are distinct from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> illustrations in style and other features, 
                    even though <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the tour sketches as the basis for some of the vignette-style illustrations, as explained in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEILLUS"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>: Missing and Unidentified Drawings for the Composite&#x2010;Genre Illustrated Travelogue (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>) and Related <date when="1833">1833</date> Tour Sketches</ref>. 
                    The <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> illustrations should be understood less as records of a tour, than as imitations of the visual media of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                    whereby British readers consumed Continental scenery through the print culture of the period. 
                    Ruskin himself makes this distinction in Praeterita, when reviewing his 1833 drawings: "With these flying scrawls on the road", 
                    he wrote, referring to the tour sketches, "I made, when staying in towns, some elaborate pencil and pen outlines, 
                    of which perhaps half-a-dozen are worth register and preservation. My father's pride in a <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833DIJON">study of the doubly-towered Renaissance church of Dijon</ref> was great. 
                    A still more laborious <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPML">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville of Brussels</ref> remains with it at Brantwood. 
                    The <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT">drawing of that H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</ref> by me now at Oxford", 
                    he added, referring to one of the drawings related to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> project, 
                    "is a copy of Prout's, which I made in illustration of the volume in which I wrote the beginning of a rhymed history of the tour" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:80-81).</p>
                    
                    <div type="subsection"><head type="section">Confusions in Cataloguing the Tour Sketches and the Illustrations for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">"Account"</title></head>
                
                <p>Despite this distinction between sources and style of the tour sketches and the illustrations, an attempt to list the tour sketches from 1833 will likely perpetuate some confusion in earlier catalogues between the two kinds of drawings, 
                    which can no longer be sorted out, since too little is known about drawings that cannot be traced. Drawings presumed to have been tour sketches may have been versions reworked for use in the fair&#x2010;copy <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> 
                    (<ref type="apparatus" target="msix_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title></ref>), but which became separated from the manuscript or were never permanently affixed there. 
                    Confusion arises, for example, in tracing the drawings of the H&#x00F4;tel de Ville, Brussels, that Ruskin mentions in Praeterita. The "laborious" <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPML">tour-sketch version</ref> 
                    does bear a consistent provenance, traceable in the Library Edition from Brantwood to the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#MANCHESTERRUSKINEXHIBITION1904">Manchester Ruskin Exhibition (1904)</title>; 
                    this drawing is now held by the Pierpont Morgan Library (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:81 n. 1; 38:236). 
                    The "still more laborious" <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT">copy</ref> of Prout's lithograph view, <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTDEVILLEBRUSSELS"><hi rend="italic">Hotel de Ville Brussells</hi></title>, from 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PROUTSKETCHES"><title type="book" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in <placeName corresp="#FLANDERS">Flanders</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 
                    is probably the same drawing that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exhibited at the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#FINEARTSOCIETYRUSKINSTURNERS1878"><orgName corresp="#FINEARTSOCIETY">Fine Art Society</orgName> (1878)</title>. 
                    In the catalogue for that exhibition, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#JRNOTESONMYOWNDRAWINGS1878">&#x201C;Notes on My Own Drawings and Engravings&#x201D;</title>, 
                    he describes the drawing as a copy after Prout, and not as an on-the-site tour sketch 
                    (<title type="catalogue" corresp="#JRNOTESBYMRRUSKIN1878"><hi rend="italic">Notes by <persName corresp="#JR">Mr. Ruskin</persName> on His Drawings by the Late <persName corresp="#JMWT">J. M. W. Turner, R.A.</persName></hi></title>, 
                    in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 13:505). 
                    This drawing appears to be the same as one now held by the Ruskin Library, Lancaster (<ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUT"><hi rend="italic"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, after <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></hi></title></ref>); 
                    and it would be logical to associate this drawing with the MS IX fair copy of the "Account", which does present a blank gap above the header for the section, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_pcs_corpus_brussels"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSCOMP">&#x201C;<placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                    The Lancaster drawing, however, is too large to have been tipped into this gap in MS IX, whereas a drawing more likely to have been intended for that space 
                    emerges in the provenance record as a possible <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY">miniature" version</ref> of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s copy after Prout, 
                    which was exhibited at the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#RUSKINEXHIBITIONCONISTON1900"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Memorial Exhibition, Mechanics' Institute, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName> (<date when="1900">1900</date>)</title>. 
                    The location of this drawing is unknown; and its <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900"><title type="catalogue" corresp="#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900">catalogue</title></ref> description 
                    by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> is ambiguous (see, for further discussion, <ref type="figure" target="brussels_hotel_de_ville_drawing_msix.php"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY"><placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName></title></ref>; see also 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEILLUS">Missing and Unidentified Drawings for the Composite&#x2010;Genre Illustrated Travelogue [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>] and Related <date when="1833">1833</date> Tour Sketches</ref>). 
                    Such confusion seem to beset the cataloguing of drawings especially from the 1833 tour, because of their near relation to Ruskin's production of illustrations for "Account" in 1833-34. 
                    Despite this caveat, in both the 1830s and the 1870s-80s, Ruskin maintained a distinction between his tour sketching 
                    and his imitation of illustrated travel literature--the latter entailing, at least in the case of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELS">H&#x00F4;tel de Ville</placeName> drawings, 
                    an elaborate exploration of visual media, which led Ruskin first to copy Prout on the scale of a lithograph, and then to reduce that copy to the scale of a steel-engraved vignette.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another source of obscurity in distinguishing the tour sketches from the illustrations for the "Account" may lie, not only with an inability to identify a catalogued work and trace it to its current location, 
                        but also with errors or duplications in the cataloguing itself. For example, according to the <title type="catalogue" corresp="#CATALOGUEOFRUSKINSDRAWINGSLE">&#x201C;Catalogue of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Drawings&#x201D;</title> 
                        compiled for the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, an 1833 item, 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833VIGNETTESOFITALIANSCENES"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRITALIANSCENES1833"><hi rend="italic">Sketches, Vignettes of Italian Scenes</hi></title></ref>, 
                        was exhibited at the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#RUSKINEXHIBITIONCONISTON1900"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Memorial Exhibition, Mechanics&#x02BC; Institute, <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName> (<date when="1900">1900</date>)</title>, referencing no. 7 in the 
                        catalogue of the exhibition, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900"><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900"><hi rend="italic"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> Exhibition</hi></title></ref>.
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 38:259 [no. 898]). 
                        Collingwood's catalogue entry for no. 7 reads, however, "Sheet of vignettes, redrawn from sketches in North Italy, 1833", which is nearly identical to a separately titled entry 
                        in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> catalogue--namely, 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833SHEETOFVIGNETTES"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRVIGNETTESFROMSKETCHESINNORTHITALY"><hi rend="italic">A Sheet of Vignettes, Re&#x2010;drawn from Sketches in N. Italy</hi></title></ref>

                        Did the editors of the Library Edition create two separate entries for the same item? The latter entry compounds the mystery by associating the item with a different exhibition history--not with the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#RUSKINEXHIBITIONCONISTON1900">Coniston Exhibition</title>, 
                        but with the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#MANCHESTERRUSKINEXHIBITION1904">Ruskin Exhibition, Manchester (<date when="1904">1904</date>)</title>, citing no. 6 in the

                        The present location of neither item is known. Further research may reveal a connection between either or both of these catalogue items, moreover, with a drawing that does survive in a collection,

                            If Ruskin meant that the sketch represented his first attempt at recording a historical monument during the tour of 1833, he was mistaken. The abbey ruins, which stand near Dover, would not have been accessible to him 
                            while the family awaited embarkation at Dover for the Continent, since Ruskin's cousin, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref>, makes clear in her travel diary 
                            that the family retired almost immediately on arrival in the town and departed for the steam packet early in the morning 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, 1). It is possible that Ruskin had time to sketch the abbey 
                            on the return passage through Dover in September--the family's movements at that stage are unknown, since neither Mary's journal nor 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS33A">John James Ruskin's travel diary</ref> describes the Channel crossing and return home--but 
                            it is more likely that, in Fors, Ruskin simply miscalculated his age when he made the drawing. A drawing of St. Radegund's survives 
                            among the remains of the <ref type="apparatus" target="sketchbook_1831-32_apparatus.php">Sketchbook (1831-32)</ref>, which more aptly fit

                <p>The attempt to distinguish between the 1833 tour drawings and the illustrations for the "Account" is not meant to deny any relation at all between these kinds of drawings. 
                    Sketches served as the basis for vignette illustrations, a process documented in the evolution of <ref type="figure" target="balstall_drawing_msix.php"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRBALSTALLMSIX">Vignette after &#x201C;Ancient Fortress and Rocky peak / Above the vale of Balstall&#x201D;</title></ref>; 
                    and Ruskin planned additional such adaptations of his tour sketches, as he noted in the 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTSILLUS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the <title type="composite" corresp="JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> (Table 2, Illustrations)</title></ref>, 
                    where in several instances he planned to use "my own" drawings to fashion an illustration (as opposed to adapting printed images by other artists). 
                    Moreover, Ruskin's creation of the tour sketches themselves cannot be separated entirely from the visual culture of travel-related publications that he explicitly imitated 
                    in the illustrations for the "Account". The influence of print culture on his tour sketching is perhaps what Ruskin means by remarking that he finished on-the-spot "outlines" 
                    with ideas "out of his head" later in the tour or at home in Herne Hill.</p>
                        
                        <p>Later in life, Ruskin valued what he interpreted as signs of observed nature as opposed to convention in these first Continental drawings. 
                            In Praeterita, he singles out only "half-a-dozen" 1833 drawings as "worth register and preservation" for their observable landscape truth. 
                            For example, in the 1878 <title type="exhibition" corresp="#FINEARTSOCIETYRUSKINSTURNERS1878">Fine Art Society exhibition of his own drawings</title>, 
                    Ruskin showed an 1833 drawing or group of drawings described as "a day's sketching . . . between Arona and Domo d'Ossola on the same journey", 
                    though "finished out of my head" at some later time. This work, which came to be catalogued as 
                            <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833MAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRLAGOMAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA1833"><hi rend="italic"><geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</geogName> and <placeName corresp="#DOMODOSSOLA">Domo d&#x02BC;Ossola</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 
                            Ruskin considered "interesting" for its "proper economy of paper" and "weak enthusiasm"--qualities that he may have connected with his youthful engagement with print culture. 
                            What prompted him to exhibit the work in 1878, however, was its evidence of "fastening so early" on a landscape truth that he would illustrate over two decades later 
                            in a drawing for <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters IV</hi></title>--<title type="artwork" corresp="#JRROCKOFARONA"><hi rend="italic">The Rock of Arona</hi></title>. 
                            In <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS4"><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi></title>, this drawing occurs among the chapters on "Sculpture of Mountains" 
                            to illustrate a discussion of rocky precipices. Ruskin traces the "real rock lines" that follow a "parabolic flow" in overhanging rock forms, arguing that, in nature, 
                            these parabolic lines trace a "delicate overhanging" that becomes "cautiously diminished as [the precipice] gets higher", as compared with the fantastically beetling precipices 
                            invented by Claude Lorrain and Renaissance painters, who were "fond of representing . . . overhanging of rocks with buildings on the top, 
                            and weeds drooping into the air over the edge, always thinking to get sublimity by exaggerating the projection" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 13:505; 6:310-11 and pl. 41).</p>
                
                <p>Critical treatment of the early tour sketches tends to be framed by Ruskin's own later approach, sifting factual observations from the chaff of conventionality, 
                    as in Paul H. Walton's singling out bits of "observation" amid the "timid drawing style, limited at this time by eighteenth-century conventions" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONDRAWINGS"><persName corresp="#PHW">Walton</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WALTONDRAWINGS"><hi rend="italic">Drawings of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName></hi></title></ref>, 14). 
                    Ruskin's youthful observations of nature were themselves prompted by the visual and print culture of his decade, however; and even this early, his "real" observation cannot be so starkly 
                    separated from his education in picturesque convention. In February 1834, when he received a birthday gift of <persName corresp="#WBI">William Brockedon</persName>'s 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi></title>, Ruskin could have found his sketches in Arona 
                    confirmed by Brockedon's plate <title type="artwork" corresp="WBILAGOMAGGIORE"><hi rend="italic">Lago Maggiore</hi></title>. In this engraving, which Ruskin planned to copy 
                    as an illustration for the "Account" (see <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php#ACCOUNTTOCMAGGIOREILLUS"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>: <title type="composite" corresp="#JRMAGGIORECOMP">&#x201C;<geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">Maggiore</geogName>&#x201D;</title></ref>), 
                    one finds in the distance "on the borders of the lake", according to the accompanying text, "the overhanging precipice beneath which the route of the Simplon passes to Arona"; 
                    "it is difficult to pass" beneath this precipice, Brockedon comments, "without feeling an emotion of danger" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><title type="book" corresp="#BROCKEDONILLUSTRATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Passes of the Alps</hi></title></ref>, 
                    &#x201C;The Pass of the Simplon&#x201D;, 17, 18). In Brockedon's plate, the scene is peaceful yet dramatic, dominated by the <title type="artwork" corresp="#CERANOSANCARLONE">colossal statue of St. Carlo Borromeo</title> 
                    extending a blessing over the hills. In Ruskin's poem for this section of the "Account", he erases the statue but keeps the word "colossally", 
                    applying it to the surrounding moutainous landscape, "spirits of gigantic things / Lords of the earth and air and sky" 
                    (<ref type="witness" target="it_was_an_eve_of_summer_mild_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRLAGOMAGGIORE">&#x201C;It was an eve of summer mild&#x201D; [&#x201C;Lago Maggiore&#x201D;]</title></ref>). 
                    While we will never know how Ruskin's proposed copy of Brockedon's plate might have adumbrated the "parabolic lines" that define precipices in Modern Painters Ruskin--or 
                    for that matter, what early observation of such forms can be found in <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833MAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRLAGOMAGGIOREANDDOMODOSSOLA1833"><hi rend="italic"><geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">Lago Maggiore</geogName> and <placeName corresp="#DOMODOSSOLA">Domo d&#x02BC;Ossola</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 
                    since apparently that drawing cannot be traced--the science of Ruskin's youthful observation cannot be separated from the facts and emotion related in Brockedon's text and engraving, 
                    the poetic imagery of spirits "of the earth and air and sky" drawn perhaps from Byron's Manfred, or the traveler's experiential awareness of recent history: 
                    atop the precipice above Arona stands the Rocca di Arona, a fortress owned by the Borromeo family, which in 1833 would have appeared notable for its recent reduction to a ruin by Napoleon's army in 1800.</p>
                
                <p>The multiple and interpenetrating influences on Ruskin's vision are striking in 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#DRAWINGS1833COBLENTZ"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRTOWNOFCOBLENTZ">&#x201C;Part of the Town of <placeName corresp="#COBLENZ">Coblentz</placeName> from the Northern Bank of the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName>&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                    Before the Ruskins departed for the Continent, a part of this scene was already vivid to them from Samuel Prout's lithograph, 
                    <title type="artwork" corresp="#PROUTCOBLENCE"><hi rend="italic">Coblence</hi></title>. According to Praeterita, that plate was presented as the specimen print 
                    in the shop where John and John James entered their name as a chief subscriber to Prout's 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PROUTSKETCHES"><title type="book" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in <placeName corresp="#FLANDERS">Flanders</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName></hi></title></ref>. 
                    As a regrettable loss in Ruskin's failure to complete the fair-copy "Account", he never carried through with his plan to convert this lithograph into an illustration for his work 
                    (see <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php#ACCOUNTTOCCOBLENTZILLUS">&#x201C;<placeName corresp="#COBLENZ">Coblentz</placeName>&#x201D;</ref> and gloss). 
                    Just as remarkable, however, is a souvenir of Koblenz, in which the spectator is equally oriented to the scene by early Victorian visual culture, but which would have been useless 
                    as an illustration for the "Account": the viewpoint is a panorama of the medieval buildings of Koblenz that line the bank of the Moselle. On the left end, the panorama is anchored 
                    by the Gothic <placeName type="building" corresp="#SCHOFFENHAUSKOBLENZ">Sch&#x00F6;ffenhaus</placeName> and the Romanesque <placeName type="building" corresp="#FLORINSKIRCHEKOBLENZ">Florinskirche</placeName>--the 
                    cluster of venerable sacred and public buildings that, in Prout's lithograph, form the picturesque scene surrounding the figures going about their business on the quayside above the river. 
                    Here, picturesque detail is largely suppressed in favor of spare outline, as the panorama continues to the right, revealing the city's Romanesque 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#LIEBFRAUENKIRCHEKOBLENZ">Liebfrauenkirche</placeName>, recognizable by its baroque Welschen hoods capping the towers; and onward to the opposite end, 
                    which is framed by the <placeName type="building" corresp="#ALTEBURG">Alte Burg (Old Castle)</placeName>, founded in the <date notBefore="1201" notAfter="1300">thirteenth century</date>; 
                    and the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BALDWINBRIDGE">Balduinbr&#x00FC;cke (Baldwin Bridge)</placeName>, which is connected to the castle at a right angle to the plane of the picture, 
                    spanning the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle</geogName>. The drawing exerts Ruskin's training in linear perspective, a specialty of his drawing tutor,

                            <p>The relative scarcity of surviving 1833 drawings might not be suprising for such early drawings, were it not for the eagerness with which examples were collected and exhibited, 
                                both by Ruskin himself in his infrequent exhibitions, and by his admirers in the more numerous exhibitions following soon after his death. 
                                The exhibition of these drawings in the decade after 1900 doubtless testifies to the popularity of Ruskin's autobiography, Praeterita, 
                                in which Ruskin describes his youthful art training. More generally, however, British collecting in the last quarter of the nineteenth century was 
                                marked by a desire for biographical and bibliographical comprehensiveness, from boyhood to maturity, whether of drawings or writings (see

                    &#x201C;concerted music&#x201D; performed by &#x201C;players on different instruments&#x201D;. An authentic solo performance by the designer was not reproducible on a mass scale; &#x201C;it was never . . . 
                    [the artist and engraver&#x02BC;s] intention to give the style and touch of the draughtsman, his separate individuality, his momentary mood, as shown in the very material and handling 
                    of the original sketch&#x201D;. Now this authentic individuality had come within reach of reproducibility, it seemed, with the invention &#x201C;of modern photographic engraving&#x201D;, which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                    regards as an attempt &#x201C;to reproduce the master, to <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> the authentic document&#x201D;. The means of reproduction aligns with <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s biographically 
                    oriented editorial aims: &#x201C;this is what we want here in such pictures as rightly illustrate a collection of Poems written in Youth, 
                    in bygone historic times, recording a famous man&#x02BC;s childhood and boyhood, his first impressions and fresh ideas of the world and of life&#x201D;. Photographic engraving promises to supply 
                    &#x201C;genuine records of the traditional precocity which we should like to verify: some true measure of the progress which we suspect, but cannnot otherwise trace, by which genius was developed. 
                    We want to see <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings, and not engraver&#x02BC;s plates&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</ref>, 1:v).</p>
                
                <p>In the <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891">1891 <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title></ref> (large&#x2010;paper edition only, the octavo edition containing no plates), the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPREFATORYNOTESPLATES">&#x201C;Prefatory Notes on the Plates&#x201D;</title> complements the <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</title>, 
                    but the former was placed at the front of volume one, and the latter at its end, presumably because the physical witnesses of the photogravure plates were regarded as the closest possible encounter 
                    with the actuality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youth. Comparatively, the edited and printed poems placed the material manuscripts at a step removed, mediated by the editor, although some compensation 
                    was afforded by photogravure reproduction of samples of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early handwriting, as well. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> admits that &#x201C;no reproduction can be quite the same thing as an original, if the original 
                    owe any of its interest to the more subtle artistic qualities of line and tone&#x201D;. The benefit of photogravure, in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s mind, lay in its &#x201C;mechanical reproduction by a method which, 
                    clever and charming as it is, adds nothing to . . . [the sketches&#x02BC;] cleverness and charm&#x201D;&#x2014;the mechanization assuring that what was conveyed was at least purely authentic, however deficient otherwise.
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> evidently perceived no significant contradiction between this faith in mechanization and his admission that &#x201C;<orgName corresp="#WALKERANDBOUTALL">Messrs. Walker and Boutall</orgName>&#x02BC;s photogravures&#x201D; were &#x201C;helped by <persName corresp="#GA">Mr. George Allen</persName>&#x02BC;s retouching&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, <date when="1891">1891</date>]</ref>, 1:vi). 
                    But what seemed comparatively to liberate reproduction of an artifact from human intervention in the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date> now seems quaintly like handicraft. 
                    From a <date notBefore="2001" notAfter="2100">twenty&#x2010;first century</date> perspective, the early stage of &#x201C;photogravure was a hand process&#x201D;; 
                    the skill incorporated the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</date> technique of aquatint, and &#x201C;early attempts to print photographs in ink 
                    often included efforts to retain . . . [the] capacity to manipulate the image&#x201D; through &#x201C;intrusions of handwork&#x201D;
