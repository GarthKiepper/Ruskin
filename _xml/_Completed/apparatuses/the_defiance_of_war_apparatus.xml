                        <p>In London in 1816, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Peace Society was founded as a coalition of Quakers and other Dissenters, 
                            such as Congregationalists--the Ruskins' church at this time--Baptists, and of course the rationalist and progressive Unitarians, as well as 
                            Anglican  Evangelicals. Peter Brock characterizes the society as marking the emergence of an organized peace movement 
                            as compared with earlier, sporadic assertions of Christian pacifism by individuals, and as partaking of the reform optimism 
                            of the 1820s-30s generally. A middle-class movement, and never a broadly populist one, the society was intent initially on converting British opinion 
                            through pamphleteering. As the flush of optimism surrounding the Vienna Settlement gave way to rising nationalism and contests 
                            between reactionary state policies and republican movements, the Peace Society advocated nonintervention. It finally found a political platform 
                            through alliance with free-trade internationalists (Brock, Pacifism in Europe, 376-86).</p><!-- STOP -->

                            In <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date>, an international incident that had the potential to affect trade

In <date when="1826-10">October 1826</date>, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> pressured <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> to accept Russian conditions in the <date when="1826-10-07">Convention of Akkerman</date>.

                        <p>While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have heard his parents discusss these international affairs or listened to a clergyman defend the Christian ethics of pacifism, 
                            that the sentiment of his anti-war message is centered in protection of the home suggests the influence of poems and tales composed mainly by women in opposition to war and the military. 
                            One likely source of exposure to such writing was Evenings at Home by the Unitarian educationalists, 
                            <!-- note and persName -->Mrs. Barbauld and her brother John Aikin, 
                            although it is impossible to specify when and with what extent of supervision Ruskin dipped into this miscellaneous "juvenile budget" 
                            of dialogues, fables, and poems, enabling him to discover its anti-war pieces. In "Things by Their Right Names", 
                            a dialogue that has been credited to Barbauld's authorship rather than her brother's, 
                            a Father obliges the wish of his son Charles for a story about "bloody murder"; however, 
                            in place of the various props and characters of romance, the Father substitutes unexpected "right names" for these elements of the story. 
                            As Charles pieces together these words, he realizes the Father is not relating a thriller but describing a battle: 
                            "'I do not know any <hi rend="italic">murders</hi> half so bloody'", the Father concludes. 
                            The threat to home is implicit, as the family is gathered "'round the fire quite ready to hear'" a good story, 
                            only to find their expectations invaded by disturbing realities of violence 
                            (Barbauld and Aikin, Evenings at Home, 1:154-56).</p>
                        
                        <p>Other anti-war dialogues and tales in Evenings at Home, probably by Aikin or perhaps collaborations by Aikin and Barbauld, 
                            include the dramatic sketch <title type="drama" corresp="#BARBAULDTWOROBBERS">"The Two Robbers"</title>, 
                            which uses a similar strategy of substituting "right" definitions, as a captured Thracian dresses down Alexander the Great 
                            from the status of war "hero" by exposing the conqueror's actions as those a "robber" no better than the Thracian himself (2:152-56). 
                            In the dialogue <title type="lesson" corresp="#BARBAULDPRICEOFAVICTORY">"The Price of a Victory"</title>, 
                            a boy enters "his father's house" proclaiming the "glorious news" of "a complete victory", 
                            only to hear his father unpack the news by rationally weighing the illusory benefits of the victory against its hugely painful costs. 
                            The father illustrates his point with the story of a soldier who returns home from battle grotesquely wounded, 
                            and whose death causes the decline of his fiance and parents (4:52-63).</p>
                        
                        <p>Barbauld and Aikin's anti-war rhetoric in Evenings in Home is consistent with radical discourse that was shared among reformers 
                            during the Revolutionary period. The language is simpler and the ironies less biting than in Barbauld's political pamphlets, 
                            but the fact that she adapted such arguments to less sophisticated readers would have rendered the writing, with only a slight shift in circumstances 
                            at the height of the government's alarm in the 1790s, all the more subject to prosecution for sedition 
                            (Trethewey, "Lady Defender of the Revolution", 163-65, 161). 
                            Moreover, since Barbauld's mastery of shared radical discourse rendered her political writing indistinguishable from that of men, 
                            she was accused in her own time of becoming "unsexed", and over the course of the century she came to be viewed as a humorless bore 
                            (Mahon, "Sermon and Story", 29-30; McCarthy, "'A High-Minded Christian Lady'", 179-80).</p>
                        
                        <p>But while the case against war was available to Ruskin in Evenings at Home, his poem reflects little, if any, 
                            of the rational and religious discourse that was held in common by liberals and pacifists. The poem, rather, 
                            is anti-war without being anti-militarist. Perhaps a common pacifist contention that only the ruling class benefits by war 
                            can be glimpsed in the comment that war "like[s] better a king to be", but overwhelmingly the pacifist message is delivered with discordantly belligerent threats 
                            that any invading army "here shall suffering die". The gender positioning seems aggressively masculine, 
                            with the promise that war will in its turn be conquered by "he" who is "the strongest of us"--the patriarch of the household, 
                            presumably, or a military hero of the nation. This aspect of the poem may be predictable for a youth whose imagination was keenly

                        <p>For all its contradictions, Ruskin's "The Defiance of War" seems akin to women's poetry of the period that defied war more by celebrating the endurance of domestic peace 
                            than by arguing against the legitimacy of conflict--or that at least obscured their critiques of war by using medieval settings or other distancing effects 
                            (see Saunders, "Louisa Stuart Costello and Women's War Poetry"). For example, according to Felicia Hemans's 
                            "The Domestic Affections", published in 1812 when the Napoleonic Wars still raged, 
                            home is an "ark of refuge" and a "fane of rest [that] <hi rend="italic">no</hi> raging storms invade" (lines 76, 61). 
                            The poem asks rhetorically whether "war's dread scenes [can] the hallow'd ties efface" and 
                            whether "fields of carnage, days of toil, [can] destroy / The lov'd impressions of domestic joy?" (lines 111-14). 
                            Triumphantly, the poem asserts the "mystic power" of domestic affections (line 252) to overcome these and even stranger trials 
                            as well as to outlast competing but ephemeral sources of joy such as fame and genius. 
                            Doubt emerges only when evocation of "maternal love" prompts the question of "who may charm <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sleepless pang to rest" (lines 341, 343) 
                            (Hemans, Selected Poems, ed. Wolfson, 4-15).</p>
                        
                        <p>Women writers did not have to share Barbauld's politics to feel anxiety about the threat of war to the British home. 
                            As <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName> remarks, during the <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1799-11-09">Revolutionary</date>
                            and <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic</date> Era, &#x201C;many women . . . seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit 
                            were at stake in this <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1815-06-18">French war</date> as they had not been in earlier conflicts. In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                            But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <persName corresp="#MAJ">Marie&#x2010;Antoinette</persName> and the rest of the French Royal Family&#x201D;&#x2014;a regicide that

                            placement alongside poems celebrating both <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and British pride of manufacture, appears to support <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        argument that British identity, <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">South</placeName>, was forged &#x201C;not so much [by] consensus or homogeneity or centralisation at home, as [by] a strong sense of dissimilarity from those without.&#x201D; 
                        Fear of the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic other</orgName> dominated over divisions between <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFENGLAND">Anglicanism</orgName> and Dissent, and Old and New Dissent, so that Britons defended above all a &#x201C;pluralist yet aggressively Protestant polity&#x201D;; 
                        and recurrent wars with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, along with worries about Jacobite restoration, had kept alive the fear &#x201C;that the old popish enemy was still at the gates, more threatening than ever before&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, <hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 17, 19, 25, and see p. 18). The 
                        primary function of the fears expressed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.

                    <p>For a threat closer to home, one returns to the Catholic Other, even in <date when="1826">1826</date>. The <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</orgName> fear was kept alive in the years running up to the <date when="1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829</date>, perhaps all the more so in households 
                        like the Ruskins&#x02BC; that had to strain to forge together competing loyalties to form a British identity. In those post&#x2010;<date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date> years, <persName corresp="#LC">Colley</persName> points out, 
                        anti&#x2010;Catholic agitation was sustained by &#x201C;an abundance of women&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS"><hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 333).

                        equivocal underhand equally devoid of sincerity or honesty &#x0026; integrity&#x201D; and capable of &#x201C;tak[ing] Satan himself into their cabals to further their purposes 
                        to bring every thing under their subjection&#x201D; (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1829-02-13_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1829-02-13">letter of <date when="1829-02-14">14 February 1829</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 177]).</p>
                    <p>Another overdetermining possibility is that the poem also works figuratively to comment on the illness and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
