                        <p>The latest credible threat of invasion of British shores had ended, of course, in <date when="1815">1815</date> 
                            with the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date>, which closed the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</date>. 
                            Soon thereafter, in London in 1816, the Peace Society was founded as a coalition of Quakers and other Dissenters, 
                            such as Congregationalists--the Ruskins' church at this time--Baptists, and Unitarians, as well as 
                            Anglican Evangelicals. Peter Brock characterizes the society as marking the emergence of an organized peace movement 
                            as compared with earlier, sporadic assertions of Christian pacifism by individuals, and as partaking of the reform optimism 
                            of the 1820s-30s generally. A middle-class movement, and never a broadly populist one, the society was intent initially on converting British opinion 
                            through pamphleteering. As the flush of optimism surrounding the Vienna Settlement gave way to rising nationalism on the Continent, accompanied by friction 
                            between reactionary state policies and republican movements, the Peace Society advocated nonintervention. It finally found a political platform 
                            through alliance with free-trade internationalists (Brock, Pacifism in Europe, 376-86).</p><!-- STOP -->
                        
                        <p>In <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date>, near the time of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, an international incident that had the potential to affect trade 
                            occurred in the East, in connection with the <date notBefore="1821-03-06" notAfter="1832-05-07">Greek War for Independence</date> from Turkish domination. 
                            While no threat to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, the war would have interested the Ruskins for its associations with 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="byron_note.php"><persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName></ref>, who had died in <placeName corresp="#MISSOLONGHI">Missolonghi</placeName> in

                            between <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName>, whose new tsar, <persName corresp="#TS1">Nicholas I</persName>, was willing
                            to push hostilities. In <date when="1826-10">October 1826</date>, <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> pressured <placeName corresp="#TURKEY">Turkey</placeName> to accept Russian conditions in the <date when="1826-10-07">Convention of Akkerman</date>. This assured Russian influence in the

                            As it turned out, <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> joined <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#RUSSIA">Russia</placeName> to declare

                        <p>While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have heard his parents discusss these international affairs or listened to a clergyman defend the Christian ethics of pacifism, 
                            he was perhaps most influenced by attitudes toward war expressed in poetry and tales by women writers of the period whose message, like his, was centered on protection of the home. 
                            Children who grew up in Britain during the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic</date> and immediately post-Napoleonic eras 
                            were exposed to the anxieties of women who, as <persName corresp="#LC">Linda Colley</persName> remarks, 
                            &#x201C;seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit were at stake in this 
                            <date notBefore="1789-05-05" notAfter="1815-06-18">French war</date> as they had not been in earlier conflicts. 
                            In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                            But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <persName corresp="#MAJ">Marie&#x2010;Antoinette</persName> and the rest of the French Royal Family&#x201D;&#x2014;a regicide that 
                            <persName corresp="#EB">Edmund Burke</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="essay" rend="italic" corresp="#BURKEREFLECTIONS">Reflections on the Revolution in France</title> 
                            (<date when="1790">1790</date>) taught the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; generation to stigmatize specifically in terms &#x201C;of a queen who was also a wife and mother being driven by force from her home&#x201D;
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, <hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 254, 253).</p>
                        
                        <p>One source of women's anti-war writing to which Ruskin had access was Evenings at Home by the Unitarian educationalists, 
                            <!-- note and persName -->Mrs. Barbauld and her brother John Aikin. 
                            While it is impossible to specify when and with what extent of supervision Ruskin dipped into this miscellaneous "juvenile budget" 
                            of dialogues, fables, and poems, its anti-war pieces were vividly prominent. For example, the dialogue 
                            "Things by Their Right Names" (traditionally ascribed to Barbauld's authorship rather than Aikin's), 
                            a Father obliges the wish of his son, Charles, for a story about "bloody murder"; however, 
                            in place of the generic props and characters of romance that Charles anticipates, 
                            the father substitutes unexpected "right names" for elements in the story. 
                            As Charles pieces together these words, he realizes his father is not relating a thriller but describing a battle: 
                            "'I do not know any <hi rend="italic">murders</hi> half so bloody'", the Father concludes. 
                            Implicit in the father's lesson is the real threat that war poses to the English home, 
                            as the family has gathered "'round the fire quite ready to hear'" a good story, 
                            only to find their expectations invaded by graphic images of violence 
                            (Barbauld and Aikin, Evenings at Home, 1:154-56).</p>
                        
                        <p>Other anti-war dialogues and tales in Evenings at Home--probably by Aikin, or perhaps by Aikin and Barbauld collaboratively--include 
                            include the dramatic sketch <title type="drama" corresp="#BARBAULDTWOROBBERS">"The Two Robbers"</title>, 
                            which uses a strategy similar to that of "Things by Their Right Names" of substituting blunt definitions for the evasions of self-glorifying warriors. 
                            The pretensions of Alexander the Great are mocked by a lowly Thracian, who has been captured for stealing. 
                            Alexander's conquests, the Thracian explains, are no better than the robberies committed by the captive (2:152-56). 
                            Another dialogue that deflates the gains of war, <title type="lesson" corresp="#BARBAULDPRICEOFAVICTORY">"The Price of a Victory"</title>, 
                            opens with a boy bursting into "his father's house" to proclaim the "glorious news" of "a complete victory", 
                            only to be cross-examined by his father. Rationally, the father unpacks the news by weighing the illusory benefits of the victory against its hugely painful costs. 
                            The father closes his case with a story illustrating the sufferings of a soldier, who returns home from battle grotesquely wounded, 
                            and whose death causes the decline of his fiance and parents. Again, the greatest cost of war is pictured as the fall of the peaceful and prosperous home (4:52-63).</p>
                        
                        <p>Barbauld and Aikin's anti-war rhetoric in Evenings in Home has been shown to be consistent with discourse shared among Radical reformers 
                            during the Revolutionary period. The language for the children's lessons is simpler, and their ironies less biting than what Barbauld indulged in her anti-war political pamphlets. 
                            The simplicity, however, potentially increased the risk of censure for sedition during the height of the government's alarm in the 1790s, 
                            since the arguments could be construed as leading unsophisticated folk astray 
                            (Trethewey, "Lady Defender of the Revolution", 163-65, 161). 
                            Certainly, Barbauld's mastery of a shared Radical discourse drew censure because her rhetoric was indistinguishable from that of male writers. 
                            In her own time, she was accused of having "unsexed" herself. Famously, John Wilson Croker attacked her in his review of her poem, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="BARBAULD1811"><hi rend="italic">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</hi></title>, for 
                            "wander[ing] from the course in which she was respectable and useful"--as an educator and writer for children--and 
                            mistaking "her power and her duty" as a "lady-author" by presuming to comment on the affairs of empire (<!-- SOURCE -->). 
                            (see Mahon, "Sermon and Story", 29-30; McCarthy, "'A High-Minded Christian Lady'", 179-80).</p>
                        
                        <p>Why the subversive anti-war pieces for children in Evenings in Home were not treated as incendiary (if that was the case) 
                            may be because they were distanced from specific conflicts. Whatever their reception more broadly, 
                            Ruskin's "The Defiance of War" reflects little, if any, of Barbauld and Aikin's rational and religious anti-war discourse. His poem, rather, 
                            is anti-war without being anti-militarist. One can perhaps glimpse the Radical pacifist contention that only the ruling class benefits by war 
                            in Ruskin's comment that war "like[s] better a king to be". Overwhelmingly, however, his pacifist message is contradicted by discordantly belligerent threats 
                            that any invading army "here shall suffering die". Moreover, the gender positioning seems aggressively masculine, 
                            with the promise that war will in its turn be conquered by "he" who is "the strongest of us"--presumably referring to the patriarch of the household, 
                            or to a military hero of the nation.</p>
                        
                        <p>This contradiction in the poem's tone might be categorized with the conflict in work by women writers who ventured to raise their voices against war, 
                            while confessing themselves drawn to the glamour of the military 
                            (see Saunders, "Louisa Stuart Costello and Women's War Poetry").
                            Ruskin's imagination was keenly fixed on the romance of <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>, 
                            just as <persName corresp="#CBW">Charlotte</persName> and <persName corresp="#PBB">Branwell</persName> Bront&#x00EB; made <persName corresp="#AWW">Wellington</persName> the hero of their sagas.

                        <p>War poetry that was more conflicted than Barbauld and Aikin's rational dialogues may have been available to Ruskin in work by Felicia Hemans,<!-- note plus persName -->, 
                            which he certainly knew to some extent at this time. In Hemans's early poems about the Napoleonic Wars, the idea of a peaceful British home, 
                            which stands invulnerable to warfare that Britain itself wages, appears as a trope with specific uses within a larger argument. 
                            In "War and Peace--A Poem, Written at the Age of Fifteen", 
                            published in 1812 when the poet was still Felicia Dorothea Browne, the nation, "Albion", is figured as the invulnerable home.</p>

                        <p>In Evan Gottlieb's analysis of another juvenile war poem by Hemans, 
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#HEMANSENGLANDANDSPAIN"><hi rend="italic">England and Spain; or, Valour and Patriotism</hi></title> (1808), 
                            which he reads against Barbauld's <hi rend="italic">Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</hi>, 
                            Hemans seeks in the end to privilege peace over warfare; however, in order to do so, 
                            she puts "herself in the awkward position of anticipating the end of freedom-loving violence . . . for the sake of perpetual peace", despite 
                            having all along valorized Britain's imperial aggression as the means to prosperity and spread of democracy. 
                            Barbauld perceives the contradiction in this oblivious optimism and predicts that Britain's paradoxical pursuit of peace and prosperity through imperioalistic aggression--regardless 
                            of particular, seemingly justifying circumstances--will ultimately collapse (Gottlieb, "Fighting Words", 334, 338).</p>
                        
                        <p>The near-eschatological terms with which Hemans needs to represent the peaceful English home at the end of England and Spain, 
                            as well as in the paean to Albion in "War and Peace", may explain the gap between military aggression and desire for a peaceful sanctuary 
                            that Ruskin fails to bridge in "The Defiance of War". Even when Hemans at least acknowledges a contradition in her somewhat maturer poem, 
                            "The Domestic Affections" (1812), by asking rhetorically whether "war's dread scenes [can] the hallow'd ties efface" and 
                            whether "fields of carnage, days of toil, [can] destroy / The lov'd impressions of domestic joy?" (lines 111-14), she still insists 
                            that home is an "ark of refuge" and a "fane of rest [that] <hi rend="italic">no</hi> raging storms invade" (lines 76, 61). 
                            Triumphantly, the poem asserts the "mystic power" of domestic affections (line 252) to overcome all trials of adversity, 
                            just as domestic joy will outlast any competing sources of joy such as fame and genius. 
                            Doubt emerges only when evocation of "maternal love" prompts the question of "who may charm <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sleepless pang to rest" (lines 341, 343) 
                            (Hemans, Selected Poems, ed. Wolfson, 4-15).</p>
                        
                        
                        <!--    
                        <p> Hence,the martial twist given to domestic feeling in this poem is not at all out of keeping with a feminine and domestic emphasis&#x2014;an emphasis that is strong throughout

                        and recurrent wars with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, along with worries about Jacobite restoration, had kept alive the fear &#x201C;that the old popish enemy was still at the gates, more threatening than ever before&#x201D;

                        primary function of the fears expressed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.
