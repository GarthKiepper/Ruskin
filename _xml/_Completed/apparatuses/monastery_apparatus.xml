                        but more likely in <date when="1828">1828</date>; 
                        &#x201c;Book III&#x201d; and &#x201c;Book IV&#x201d; may have been completed by <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> dated the work from the <date notBefore="1828-01" notAfter="1828-06">&#x201C;early part of 1828&#x201D; or &#x201C;first half of 1828&#x201D;</date>. 
                        based on his analysis of the sequence in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered poetry selections in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>; and see 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi></title>, 1891]</ref>, 1:262, 272;

                        <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> disagreed 
                        and ascribed the work to <date when="1827">1827</date>, in the belief that the poem was &#x201c;a result of [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s] visit 
                        to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in that year&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref> 2:260 n. 1; and see 276 n. 1). 
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName> was initially inclined to accept the earlier date, because she considered the hand in the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title></ref> draft to be &#x201c;very childish&#x201d;, but then she decided that 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> had &#x201c;no legitimate basis&#x201d; 
                        for correcting <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02bc;s date of <date when="1828">1828</date> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VILJOENPAPERS">&#x201C;Helen Gill Viljoen Papers&#x201D;</ref>, box F, transcription of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The reasoning by the editors of the Library Edition seems to stand on the most speculative evidence&#x2014;namely, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s comment in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        that he &#x201c;used to read the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi></title> at <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName>, 
                        and the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> in <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glen Farg</geogName>&#x201d; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1; 35:16). 
                        While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may well have associated <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels with landmarks along the Ruskins&#x02bc; route to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in the <date notBefore="1820-01-01" notAfter="1829-12-31">1820s</date>, 
                        the editors neglect to explain why these associations should be tied so specifically to the journey of <date when="1827">1827</date>. It is not known when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first read <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> 
                        or heard it read to him. The case is strengthened, however, by the contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        the manuscript containing the fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>. Immediately preceding 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s poem occurs the anthology, <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which includes poems describing <placeName type="building" corresp="#LOCHLEVENCAS">Loch Leven Castle</placeName> and <geogName corresp="#GLENFARG">Glen Farg</geogName>&#x2014;the 
                        points along the journey to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> that, according to <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> connected with his reading of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s novels. (In fact, it may have been this evidence in 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> that originally prompted <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s comment in the autobiography, 
                        rather than this evidence independently documenting his memory.) In using this statement in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        to link <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> to the family journey to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> in <date when="1827">1827</date>, 
                        the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> evidently did not base their conclusion on the juxtaposition of the poem with 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        since they believed the latter to date from <date when="1826">1826</date> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1, and see 535). 
                        But the poems in <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> do in fact belong to the family tour of <date when="1827">1827</date>, tending to confirm <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02bc;s speculations. 
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName>&#x02bc;s qualms about a date this early can be resolved by evidence that this tour fell unusually late in <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2014;primarily 
                        in <date notBefore="1827-08" notAfter="1827-11">September and October, with departure sometime in August, and return sometime in November</date> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date></ref>).</p>
                        
                    <p>The evidence is more indirect regarding whether <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>&#x2014;or at least its first one or two books&#x2014;should be considered a contemporaneous 
                        with the <date when="1827">1827</date> <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> project, 
                        or, as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> contends, an insertion in that place from a later time. As explained in 
                        <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, the only documented record of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s labor 
                        on <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> dates from <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, 
                        and even that passing reference in a letter is ambiguous. The statement might mean that, at that time, he was returning to composition and/or fair copy of the poem itself, 
                        or that he was working on something in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, which he meant to simply identify by its contents&#x2014;that is, 
                        the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> known in the family for its containing 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>. Based on the concatenation of evidence 
                        in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, it appears likely that, in <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, 
                        he did compose and/or fair&#x2010;copy some portion of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>&#x2014;probably, 
                        Books III&#x2013;IV (which he left incomplete)&#x2014;while Books I&#x2013;II date from an earlier period. This period may be as early as 
                        <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1827-12">between September and December 1827</date>, but more likely from some time in <date when="1828">1828</date>. 
                        The poem&#x02bc;s associations with travel to Scotland may not derive from the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><date when="1827">Tour of 1827</date></ref>, 
                        but from the sadder occasion of mourning the loss of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_jessie_note.php"></ref><persName corresp="#JRP">Aunt Jessie</persName>,

                        Initial composition may therefore have significantly predated <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201c;finishing&#x201d; of <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>.

                        There is no physical break between the anthology and the &#x201c;novel&#x201d; to indicate a change in genre or project, 
                        so it is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> considered <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> to be a continuation of the <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        Given the inclusion in <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> of travel poems

                        and the juxtaposition of these poems with the verse novel, this portion of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> 
                        bears witness to (and may even have inspired) <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s autobiographical recollection that he 
                        &#x201c;used to read the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi></title> at <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName>,

                        and thought that the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> had as certainly lived by the streamlet [the <geogName corresp="#FARG">Farg</geogName>] in that glen of the <geogName corresp="#OCHILS">Ochils</geogName>,

                        As further evidence shows, however, while <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> establishes a lower limit 
                        in the time of composition for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, the two projects were distinct.</p>

                        for composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, how much time separated the verse novel from the tour poem anthology? For this question, the only evidence is handwriting. 
                        The hand for the verse novel uses print lettering similar to that for <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, but smaller. 
                        Size of lettering in fact varies considerably within the anthology, as well, the smallest being used for its first poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="ragland_castle_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRRAGLANDCASTLE">&#x201c;Ragland Castle&#x201d;</title></ref>. Still, regardless of size, and despite the similarity in formation of letters, 
                        there is greater affinity between the lettering throughout the poems in <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        and the lettering used for the original versions of two of its poems, <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title></ref> 
                        (as first fair&#x2010;copied in a <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter</title></ref> by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to his father), 
                        than between the respective hands for the poetry anthology and for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The orthography of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> is distinctive for its studied attention to punctuation, which is largly neglected in the <date when="1827">1827</date> fair copies 
                        of <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title></ref>, and the poems in <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        Almost every line of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> ends with a prominent comma, formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl, although the commas 
                        hover above the baseline like a swimming tadpole. There are also semicolons, which are almost consistently formed upside down, with the comma above the point. 
                        The eccentricity of the punctuation resembles the usage in <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>. Here, too, the commas are typeface&#x2010;like, 
                        though they now fall on the baseline; there are no upside&#x2010;down semicolons, although a new oddity turns up in the form of a two&#x2010;point ellipsis, like a colon on its side, its function unclear. 
                        (<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> is also punctuated with colons, but their rhetorical or grammatical function is obscure.) 
                        Most tellingly linking the punctuation practice in <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> with that in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        in both cases the dense but confusing marks abruptly give out altogether after several pages of fair&#x2010;copying, suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added the punctuation all at once, 
                        layering over top of the already fair&#x2010;copied text. Evidently, he had not yet learned to integrate punctuation as a rhetorical and grammatical element of writing, 
                        but treated it as effectively a decorative feature to enhance the imitation of typeface.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself dated <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> as <date when="1828-09-28">28 September 1828</date> 
                        (whether he meant the beginning or end of that project), a timeline takes shape starting with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s first use of pen and ink, 
                        which his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName> documented in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). This is the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>

                        orthographically and thematically more akin to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title> than to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        which shares a style of punctuation and other features with <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title>. (The latter two works are also alike in being divided into &#x201c;books&#x201d;.) 
                        This suggests that, despite the lack of a physical separation between the poetry anthology and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, the projects were separated by a number of months, falling between the Ruskins&#x02BC; return to <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> 
                        from <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> in <date when="1827-11">November 1827</date> and the composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title> in <date when="1828-09">September 1828</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>This first stage of composition and fair&#x2010;copying appears clearly demarcated in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        with books 1&#x2013;2 extending from the title, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;THE MONASTERY&#x201D;</title>,  to almost the end of the notebook (pp. 70&#x2013;80). 
                        On p. 80, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> concludes with a colophon, &#x201c;<hi rend="caps">END OF BOOK SECOND</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">HERNE HILL</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">DULWICH</hi>&#x201d;. 
                        Inserted above the &#x201c;<hi rend="caps">END OF BOOK SECOND</hi>&#x201d; is a direction to the reader to &#x201c;go back to page 52&#x201d; 
                        (since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had run out of available space at the end of the notebook), 
                        and on that earlier page the poem resumes with book 3, and extends through book 4, which breaks off incomplete on p. 58, after 52 lines of verse.</p>
                    
                    <!-- START TAGGING HERE -->
                    <p>While a hiatus in composition would not have corresponded necessarily with the end of fair-copying book 2, since the fair-copying was delimited in any case 
                        by the physical end of the red book, it seems probable that Ruskin signaled a more significant break by adding the "publication" information 
                        &#x201c;<hi rend="smallcaps">HERNE HILL</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">DULWICH</hi>&#x201d;. No evidence proves when he inserted the direction to &#x201c;go back to page 52&#x201d;, 
                        but handwriting evidence in book 3 suggests that he created that extension at a different time and under other circumstances. This division in the stages 
                        of composition is further supported by two separate surviving witnesses of rough draft in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        <ref type="witness" target="now_must_we_leave_poor_martin_there_msia.php">&#x201c;now must we leave poor martin there&#x201d;</ref> and

                        The first, which is a draft of a portion of book 2, is written in cursive with pencil; the second, which is a draft of a portion of book 3, 
                        is written in cursive with pen and ink. When Ruskin first began to use pen and ink in 1827, he restricted his penmanship to fair-copy printing, 
                        while continuing to rely on pencil for cursive script. Later, he transitioned to pen and ink for both fair-copy print and cursive draft 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). 
                        An example of the former is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter</title></ref> to his father, 
                        in which he fair-copied the poems <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201c;Wales&#x201d;</title></ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201c;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201d;</title></ref>, in ink print lettering, 
                        but wrote the body text of the letter in pencil cursive. An example of the latter is the 1828-29 handmade pamphlet, <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS II</title></ref>, 
                        which includes ink cursive draft of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> and

                        which are fair-copied in ink print lettering elsewhere.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since the first stage of composition probably comprised books 1-2 in 1828, what occasioned the work? A conjecture based on internal evidence, 
                        and in keeping with the physical evidence for dating and composition, is the death of Janet ("Jessie") Richardson, the sister of John James Ruskin, in Perth 
                        on 18 May 1828. As internal evidence of this connection, Ruskin condensed and rearranged opening episodes of Scott's novel to emphasize its supernatural aspects. In addition, 
                        as an internal reflection of the immediate consequence of Jessie's death--the Ruskins' adoption of the only surviving Richardson daughter, Mary, into the Herne Hill household--Ruskin's 
                        book 2 is a detailed rendering of an episode that tangentially concerns adoption. In the novel, a benign captain of an English raiding party, Stawarth Bolton, 
                        confronts Elspet Glendinning and her two sons, and half-jokingly offers to adopt either the "blue eyed" and reverential younger brother, Edward, 
                        or the "black eyed" and feisty older brother, Halbert. For Scott, the purpose of the episode was primarily to dramatize the English policy, following their 
                        victory at the Battle of Pinkie Cleuch, of balancing assurances of protection for compliant Scots, especially Protestants, with threats of destruction against defiant 
                        Scots patriots (see Discussion: The Historical Context of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s Novel and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s Arrangement of His Selections). 
                        While the version in Ruskin's MS III fair copy does play out details connected these political and military themes, the text in the MS IA pencil draft, 
                        <ref type="witness" target="now_must_we_leave_poor_martin_there_msia.php">"now must we leave poor martin there"</ref>, is condensed around the theme of adoption. 
                        For more conjecture about the family events underlying stage one of composition, see Discussion: The Family Context of Composition".</p>

                    <p>To return to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>'s observation on 4 March 1829 that 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> had &#x201c;commenced writing a novel &#x0026; a Sermon&#x201d;

                        the second stage of composition--a resumption of "The Monastery", although Margaret could reasonably perceive it as a commencement--can indeed be correlated 
                        with sermon materials composed between <date notBefore="1829-02" notAfter="1829-05">February&#x2013;May 1829</date>: the fragments,

                        (i.e., the <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref> draft witness, <ref type="witness" target="description_of_skiddaw_and_lake_derwent_msii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSII">&#x201c;description of skiddaw &#x0026; lake derwent&#x201d;</title></ref>). 
                        These writings are associated with John's infatuation with the <!-- ref note -->Reverend Edward Andrews, which he shared with his cousin Mary Richardson, 
                        now very much at home in Camberwell.</p>
                    
                    <p>The hypothesis that this second stage of composition of "The Monastery" comprises books 3 and 4 accords well with physical evidence in MS III. 
                        The pages occupied by these latter two books (pp. 52&#x2013;58, plus three blank pages, 59&#x2013;61) 
                        take up the available leaves in MS III that fall between pages containing a group of poems dated <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date> (pp. 36&#x2013;50, plus a blank p. 51) 
                        and the leaves containing the <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> (pp. 62&#x2013;70). 
                        When <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> turned to these interstitial leaves to continue with books 3&#x2013;4 
                        (having used up the leaves at the end of the notebook to fair-copy books 1-2), the space occupied by <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> 
                        unquestionably presented him with a terminus ad quem for available space, while a terminus a quo was likely already present 
                        in the form of the <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date> poetry group--or that group was at least underway.</p>
                    
                    <p>The inference that the March 9 group must have been in place or underway cannot now be proven, but that scenario is more persuasive than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having decided in 1829 
                        to resume book 3 on p. 52 arbitrarily, with nothing in particular framing that space. Rather, "The Monastery" can be regarded as part of the 
                        project that Ruskin reported to his father on <date when="1829-03-10">10 March 1829</date>, his determination to &#x201C;get that <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">red book</ref> of mine 
                        [<ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>] 
                        which has <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">the Monastery</title> in it finished, by the time you come home&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 192). 
                        By prominently and repeatedly inditing the date <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date> among that group of poems, 
                        Ruskin was evidently concerned to demonstrate his success in meeting this deadline 
                        (see the commentary on the last&#x2010;copied <date when="1829-03-09">March 9</date> poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="of_rocks_first_and_of_caverns_now_i_sing_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JROFROCKSFIRST">&#x201C;Of rocks first and of caverns now i sing&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        However, he left the "The Monastery" unfinished, with marginal line numbering trailing into unfilled space on p. 58 and three available pages left blank. 
                        By this time, Ruskin's attention must have been diverted from the narrative poem--which, in any case, conceptually presented an endless drudgery, especially 
                        since Scott's novel had a sequel, The Abbot--and he was now absorbed in composing a major loco-descriptive poem for his father's 10 May 1829 birthday, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        Whether Ruskin achieved a form of closure in "The Monastery" is another question. He turned aside from a gothic narrative, which for him was coded with the severing of connections in Scotland, 
                        in exchange for a poem in the picturesque mode that reopened a thwarted desire for the Lake District.</p>
                    
                    <p>There is no surviving draft from the second stage of composing "The Monastery" that Ruskin neglected to fair-copy. 
                        The <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref> ink, longhand lines,

                    <p>The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy of book 3 shares some handwriting features with Ruskin's <date when="1829-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1829</date> productions,

                            <persName corresp="#KH8">Henry</persName> hoped to break <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>&#x02bc;s traditional alliance with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and annex the country as part of assuring the Tudor succession. 
                            In <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, a treaty to this effect was guided by <persName corresp="#JHEA">James Hamilton, earl of Arran</persName> (<date notBefore="1519" notAfter="1575-01-22">1519&#x2013;75</date>), 
                            who had been appointed governor of <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and tutor to the child <persName corresp="MQS">Mary</persName> upon the death of <persName corresp="#KJ5">James V</persName>. 
                            As a <orgName corresp="#PROTESTANTISM">Protestant</orgName>, <persName corresp="#JHEA">Arran</persName> had been the first to propose the future union of the two royal heirs. 
                            At home, however, an anti&#x2010;English faction quickly formed against him, composed of clergy and nobles. The Scottish parliament 
                            did prepare a treaty agreeing to the marriage, but preserving Scottish sovereignty, terms that <persName corresp="#KH8">Henry</persName> would not accept. 
                            The arrangement foundered, with the Scottish parliament now condemning the treaty; Mary was crowned queen of Scots; 
                            and the anti&#x2010;English, pro&#x2010;Catholic faction reaffirmed the <orgName corresp="#AULDALLIANCE">Auld Alliance</orgName> with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>.

                            with no allowance for separate sovereignty. He appointed troops under <persName corresp="#ESEH">Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford</persName> (<date notBefore="1500" notAfter="1552-01-22">1500&#x2013;52</date>), to &#x201c;put all to fyre and swoord&#x201d;.

                        <!-- START HERE -->                 <p>In his selection of episodes, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lifts events out of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s narrative sequence, 
                            and begins with an episode centered on the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>. The apparition is the spectral protector 
                            of the Avenel family, and she is particularly watchful over <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</persName>&#x02bc;s vernacular bible--the 
                            novel's recurring metonymic sign of forbidden Protestant worship within the monastery's sacred sphere, its "halidome". Overall, Ruskin's selections de&#x2010;emphasize the novel&#x02bc;s staging of complex political conflict surrounding the Scottish Reformation, 
                            and instead favor the story&#x02bc;s supernatural elements. The focus seems chosen in part for the sake of the supernaturalism in itself, 
                            although the choice effectively favors Scottish Protestantism at the cost of Scott's latitudinarian purpose. As summarized in Scott's Magnum Opus preface to the novel, 
                            the novel's aim is "to conjoin two characters [i.e., the monastery Sub-Prior Eustace and the Reform preacher Henry Warden] 
                            in that bustling and contentious age who, thrown into situations which gave them different views on the subject of the Reformation, 
                            should, with the same sincerity and purity of intention, dedicate themselves, the one to the support of the sinking fabric of the Catholic Church, 
                            the other to the establishment of the Reformed doctrines" (Caledonian Edition, 17:ix). As commented in contextual glosses on the text, 
                            Ruskin tips the scales of Scott's ecumenical aim by coloring particular passages with Protestant discourse and by foregrounding in the overall arrangement the supernatural interventions 
                            of White Lady in defense of the Protestant vernacular bible.</p>
                        
                        <p>Ruskin omits the names of the monastery fathers, with the exception of Eustace, referring to them only (and sometimes confusingly) as &#x201c;the monk&#x201d;, 
                            &#x201c;the abbot&#x201d;, and so on. The neglect may suggest that he avoided personalizing the <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Roman Catholic</orgName> characters, 
                            especially since he names each of the Scottish characters. Confusion may also have arisen, however, from his unfamiliarity with monastic titles, which he gets wrong in places. 
                            He also mistakes the military rank of the English soldier, Stawarth Bolton.</p>

                                    The action begins with a monk (<persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERPHILIP">Father Philip</persName>, the sacristan of 
                                    the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#SAINTMARYMONASTERY">Monastery of Saint Mary</placeName>) being 
                                    denied passage over the <geogName corresp="#TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</geogName> by the warder of the drawbridge. 
                                    Preparing to ford the river on his mule, he encounters the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName>. 
                                    Supposing her to be a woman stranded on the bank by the churlish bridge-ward, he offers to carry her across the stream, 
                                    only to be thrown from his mount by the spirit, when they reach deep water. While Ruskin's poem mentions that 
                                    <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERPHILIP">the monk</persName> grasps &#x201c;a black volume&#x201d;&#x2014;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#LADYAVENEL">Lady Avenel</persName>&#x02bc;s vernacular bible, 
                                    which he has confiscated&#x2014;the poem omits explanation of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERPHILIP">Philip</persName>&#x02bc;s discovery 
                                    of the forbidden book on a pastoral visit to the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#TOWEROFGLENDEARG">Tower of Glendearg</placeName>,

                                    The poem also passes over the monks&#x02bc; expressions of zeal (in <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02bc;s chapters 5, 6, and 7) 
                                    to crush heretical Reform ideas infiltrating the halidome. Cutting to the end of chapter 7, 
                                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> follows <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FATHERPHILIP">Philip</persName> home to the monastery,

                                <item><list><item><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> efficiently condenses the introduction of the main Scottish characters. 
                                    He touches on the Battle of Pinkie to explain conditions at the Tower of Glendearg, which is bereft of its master, the yeoman Simon Glendinning; 
                                    and (skipping to the opening of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chapter 3), he draws a parallel with the estate of Avenel, 
                                    likewise absent of its baron, Walter Avenel, who has been killed "for the good of his country in battle". Still continuing with Scott's chapter 3, 
                                    Ruskin introduces the widow, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LADYAVENEL">Alice, Lady Avenel</persName> 
                                    and her daughter, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYAVENEL">Mary Avenel</persName>. Thus, he reverses the order of Scott's introduction of characters, 
                                    which begins in chapter two with the yeoman's widow, Elspet Glendinning, and her two sons--Halbert, the elder; and Edward, the younger--in chapter 2. 
                                    By beginning with the knighted class of characters, Ruskin maintains a connection with the "avenel haunt" that he introduces in book 1, 
                                    though at the cost of some confusion over what "foe" drives Lady Avenel and Mary to seek refuge in the farmer&#x02BC;s cottage 
                                    of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MTACKET">Martin</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TTACKET">Tibb Tacket</persName>, 
                                    whom Ruskin introduces here, as does Scott in chapter 3. The threat that alarms them, of "english barbarians that plunder the land", 
                                    refers to Somerset's occupation of the Border after Pinkie Cleuch, 
                                    and his attempt to win over Scottish Protestants by combining the coercion of raids with the persuasion of assurances. 
                                    This context is supplied as Ruskin swings back to <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chapter two, 
                                    and the confrontation between the English captain, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#STAWARTHBOLTON">Stawarth Bolton</persName>, 
                                    and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#ELSPETGLENDINNING">Dame Glendinning</persName> and her two sons. Ruskin dwells on this episode in considerable detail, 
                                    clearly finding great interest in the boys' contrasting personalities and their respective responses to Bolton's bestowal of his protection and 
                                    his half-joking offer to adopt either of the boys.</item>

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s favoring the supernatural episodes, and the White Lady in particular, 
                            reversed the majority opinion in the critical reception of the novel. 
                            In the Magnum Opus preface (published in 1830, after the date of Ruskin's poem [Millgate, Scott's Last Edition, 24]), 
                            Scott admitted that the White Lady "was far from being popular" (Caledonian Edition, 17:xx). Reviewers' objections centered on the "machinery" 
                            of the White Lady's interventions. In the view of Nassau Senior (1790-1864), writing in 1821 for the Quarterly Review, Scott neglected to explain "what he intends to represent" 
                            by the White Lady. Senior could discern "no motives" for the character, except to carry forward a poorly "digested plan" for the novel--a mechanism reflected in the novel's "disproportion of parts"

                            see also Senior, Essays on Fiction, 55). Similarly, in 1820, the reviewer for the Edinburgh Magazine 
                            considered the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> merely "opportune", her "insufferable" manifestations ludicrously suggesting the meddling of a "female Puck or Robin Goodfellow"

                            Such "machinery is introduced to no ultimate purpose", chimed in the Edinburgh Monthly Review, 
                            "and every thing [the White Lady] does, is absurd almost to childishness" 
                            (<title type="essay" corresp="#REVIEWSCOTTMONASTERYEDINBURGHMONTHLYREVIEW">Unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">The Monastery: A Romance</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">The Abbot</hi></title>, 694).</p>
                        
                        <p>For the high-spirited young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, episodes that struck sober reviewers as childish, 
                            such as the White Lady's dunking Father Philip in the Tweed, may well have seemed just good fun. 
                            At the same time, Ruskin felt the mystery of the White Lady, as suggested by the incantation with which he begins his poem. 
                            In capturing this mood of the novel, Ruskin's response might be compared to that of the reviewer for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, 
                            who was untroubled by the other reviewers' standard for a credible plot, instead finding merit 
                            in "the <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> of the Monastery" as "a calm enjoyment" (emphasis in original): "Nothing can be more delightful; 
                            but nothing at the same time can be more quiet. The different scenes spread themselves out in a fine variegated and easy succession". 
                            The reviewer relates this unfolding of varying scenes and moods to Scott's composition of novel. 
                            In the aftermath of the author's previous "extraordinary exertions" over Ivanhoe, the reviewer imagines, Scott was 
                            "induced . . . to linger so very near home" in the novel's Border setting, and "to luxuriate over the silence of his own pastoral glens, 
                            the music of his own haunted mountain-brooks--and the calm domestic magnificence of that unrivalled landscape" and "stately beauty of Melrose"

                        <head type="subsection">The Family Context of Composition</head>
                        <p>As proposed in Composition and Publication: Stage One of Composition, circa 1828, Ruskin's composition of "The Monastery" 
                            may have been prompted by the death his Aunt Jessie in May 1828, and the adoption of his cousin, 
                            <!-- ref note -->Mary Richardson (1815-49), into the household in July 1828. 
                            (John James also committed to financial support of the three surviving sons; see <!-- ref note --> Jessie Richardson [1783-1828].) 
                            These events can be seen reflected in the outcome of 
                            stage one of composition, books 1 and 2 of "The Monastery", especially if these two books are considered 
                            as constituting a work in itself, finished off with a colophon on p. 80. Book 1 narrates a haunting by a supernatural spirit of Scottish lore, 
                            followed by book 2 and its banter about possible adoption--the latter being almost the sole theme represented in the MS IA draft fragment of book 2 
                            (in MS III, developed with additional details from the Scott novel). Even the comedy in book 1, 
                            the White Lady's fording the river with Father Philip after he was denied passage across the bridge, 
                            suggests uncanny connections with family history. The Richardsons lived at Bridge End on the east end of Perth Bridge, 
                            before moving across the river to Rose Terrace, on the North Inch. In Praeterita, 
                            Aunt Jessie is credited with a "foresight dream" of river crossings, foreboding her own death as well as the deaths 
                            of Ruskin's younger cousin, Jessie (1820-27), and an old servant, Mause 
                            (Ruskin, Works, 35:70-71; for more on the thematic resonance of Scott's Monastery throughout Ruskin's career, see 
                            Sawyer, Ruskin's Poetic Argument, 17-19).</p>
                        
                        <p>Aunt Jessie's death interrupted a family tour to the west country and the Lake District. The family was in Plymouth when the news 
                            reached them on 24 May 1828. Ruskin recalls in Praeterita returning from a walk with his nurse, Anne Strachan, "on the hill east of the town 
                            [Plymouth Hoe], looking out on the bay and breakwater, and came in to find my father, for the first time I had ever seen him, 
                            in deep distress of sobbing tears" (Ruskin, Works, 35:71). The Ruskins abbreviated but did not immediately terminate their tour, 
                            continuing to visit sites in the southwest: there is no evidence that they traveled to Scotland (see Tour of 1828).</p>
                        
                        <p>More enigmatic is how the spirit of that deceased cousin, Jessie, may also hover over Ruskin's adaptation of the novel. 
                            In Praeterita, Ruskin memorializes Jessie as an inseperable playmate, both in their exhibitions of precocious infant piety 
                            and in their unhindered romps among streams and fields (Ruskin, Works, 35:63, 66, 69). Three years passed after her death in 1827, 
                            before Ruskin directly acknowledged her passing in "On the Death of My Cousin Jessy". The exact date of her death at age eight is not recorded 
                            by Viljoen in Ruskin's Scottish Heritage, presumably because the date is not discoverable (157, 182, 185), but one wonders if this loss 
                            contributed to delaying the Ruskins' Scotland journey in 1827, and then solemnized the long two-month visit in September and October 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><date when="1827">Tour of 1827</date></ref>). 
                            This death too, then, would have contributed to Ruskin's feelings in choosing to summarize Scott's novel in the next year.</p>
                        
                        <p>Intriguingly, however, Ruskin abandoned his project (so far as we know) just short of bearing witness, not to the death of a mother or daughter, 
                            but of a father--Mary Avenel's haunting by the spirit of Sir Walter Avenel.</p>
                        
                        <p>For Ruskin, the mystery of the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#WHITELADY">White Lady</persName> 
                            seems to have been further deepened by association with <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s Witch of the Alps. 
                            Francis Jeffrey noticed this connection, as well. Reviewing the novel for the Edinburgh Review in 1822, he considered 
                            "the first apparition of the spirit [the White Lady] by her lonely fountain (though borrowed 
                            from Lord Byron's Witch of the Alps in Manfred)" to be "very beautifully imagined", justifying the powerful 
                            "effect of the interview on the mind of the young aspirant to whom she reveals herself 
                            [Halbert Glendinning]". While Jeffrey draws the line, like other reviewers, at the White Lady's bizarre "descent" with Halbert 
                            "into an alabaster cavern, and the seizure of a stolen Bible from an altar blazing with cold flames", 
                            which he compares to "an unlucky combination of a French fairy tale and a dull German romance", 
                            he did not consider the Romantic-inspired image of the White Lady "the worst blemish of 'the Monastery'"

                            see also Jeffrey, Contributions to the Edinburgh Review, 3:483). For Ruskin, this image seems to have 
                            reverberated with a fascination deeply rooted in the juvenila, starting with
