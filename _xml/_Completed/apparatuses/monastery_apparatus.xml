                    <p>On <date when="1829-03-04">March 4, 1829</date>, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> refers to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s writing &#x201C;a novel&#x201D; (RFL, 185)&#x2014;i.e., 
                        this versification of the opening of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s novel, <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title></hi>. 
                        On <date when="1829-03-10">March 10</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> writes to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, 
                        &#x201C;I am trying to get that red book [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>] of mine which has <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">the Monastery</title> in it finished, by the time you come home&#x201D; (RFL, 192).</p>
                    <p>In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>&#x201D; is placed following an earlier, late&#x2010;<date when="1827">1827</date> group of poems called &#x201C;poetry descriptive&#x201D; (see no. 12) 
                        but in a more mature hand than that earlier group. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copied his books 1 and 2 of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>&#x201D; until he ran out of room at the end of the book, 
                        and then continued with books 3 and 4 on some available blank leaves before the &#x201C;poetry descriptive&#x201D; but immediately following a group of poems dated <date when="1829-03-09">March 9, 1829</date> (see no. 47). 
                        Thus, &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>&#x201D;&#x2014;or, at the very least, its second and third books&#x2014;was finished at about the same time as the <date when="1829-03-09">March 9</date> group 
                        (so far, that is, as &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>&#x201D; ever did reach completion).</p>
                    <p><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> includes a one&#x2010;sheet, ink, longhand set of lines that forms part of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> poem&#x02BC;s &#x201C;book third,&#x201D; 
                        as well as a one&#x2010;sheet pencil version of part of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> poem&#x02BC;s &#x201C;book second&#x201D; (see part 2, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, &#x201C;Content,&#x201D; a). 
                        It is possible that the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> pencil version of part of &#x201C;book second&#x201D; is earlier than 1829, 
                        since the fair copy of &#x201C;book third&#x201D; is the portion positioned following the <date when="1829-03-09">March 9</date> group in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                        while &#x201C;book second&#x201D; runs continuously to the end of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. Even the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> ink version of part of &#x201C;book third,&#x201D; conceivably, 
                        could significantly predate its <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date> fair&#x2010;copying. Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1829-03-10">March 10</date> letter implies that <persName corresp="#JJR">his father</persName> was already familiar with some portion of the project.</p>
                    <p>The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copies, then, do hold open the possibility of a starting date perhaps up to a year prior to the project&#x02BC;s termination in <date when="1829">1829</date>. 
                        Moreover, given <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hectic pace of writing and fair&#x2010;copying for <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date> and for <persName corresp="#JJR">his father</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1829-05-10">1829 birthday</date> (see nos. 32&#x2013;33, 57), 
                        it seems barely credible that even <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have produced all of his &#x201C;novel&#x201D; during the same period. 
                        If these indications are sound, I believe the onset of composition is unlikely to have been much earlier than the <date notBefore="1828-05" notAfter="1828-08">middle of 1828</date>, however, 
                        since the handwriting and punctuation in the first two books is reminiscent of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>&#x201D; (no. 27).</p>
                    <p>Earlier editors&#x02BC; assignment of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>&#x201D; to <date when="1827">1827</date> or <date when="1828">1828</date> seems based on merely impressionistic and circumstantial evidence. 
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> viewed the hand in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title> as extremely childish, but it in fact resembles other instances of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cursive rough&#x2010;draft hand in <date when="1829">1829</date>. 
                        No firmer evidence is offered either by <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> or by <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> for their respective dates of <date when="1827">1827</date> and <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2014;the editors 
                        apparently guessing on the basis of remarks in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, the appearance of the handwriting in the manuscripts, 
                        and connections between the setting of the poem and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s travels to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> 
                        (see Works, 2:260 n. 1, and PJR, 263, 273; see also, however, part 1, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, “Content,” a, 
                        for the caveat that the early editors may have had access to manuscript of the poem that is now lost).</p>
                    <p>Since the extant manuscript evidence places books 3&#x2013;4 of the poem (or, at least, their fair&#x2010;copying) squarely in <date when="1829">1829</date>, 
                        while only permitting an earlier date for books 1&#x2013;2, the case for assigning an earlier date to some portion of the poem must depend on internal evidence&#x2014;the events 
                        captured from <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s novel</title>, and the order in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> set them to verse. See Discussion: since book 1 lifts events out of their order in <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Scott</title>, 
                        the poem could represent an earlier, isolated versification, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> only later in <date when="1829">1829</date> decided to develop&#x2014;&#x201C;commenc[ing] writing a novel,&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#MR">his mother</persName> said.</p></div>
                <div type="section" xml:id="DISCUSSION">
                    <head type="section">Discussion</head>
                    <p>The versified selections are as follows: <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s book 1 begins with the latter half of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chap. 5, 
                        the Sacristan&#x02BC;s failure to gain passage over the drawbridge and, in fording the <placeName corresp="#TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</placeName> on horseback, his encounter with the White Lady; 
                        and book 1 ends by briefly summarizing portions of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chap. 7, the Abbot and Father Eustace&#x02BC;s resolve on hearing the Sacristan&#x02BC;s adventure.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s book 2 begins with the opening of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chap. 3, the widowing of the Lady of Avenel and her removal with her daughter 
                        to the shepherd&#x02BC;s cottage of Martin and Tibb Tacket; and book 2 then moves to <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chap. 2, 
                        the confrontation between Captain Stawarth Bolton and Dame Glendinning and her two sons of Glendearg.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s book 3 versifies the remainder of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chap. 3&#x2014;Martin, Tibb, Mary, and the Lady of Avenel&#x02BC;s journey 
                        to Dame Glendinning&#x02BC;s residence in Glendearg (which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> calls &#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; and &#x201C;Glendarg&#x201D; [see Works, 35:16]), 
                        and their attempted passage across a bog, when Mary and the pony Shagram see the White Lady signaling them to safety.</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s book 4 is from <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chap. 4, the apparition of her dead father to Mary Avenel on Halloween night.</p>
                    <p>That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s book 1 lifts events out of their sequential narrative order in <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Scott</title>&#x2014;therefore, possibly representing 
                        an earlier, isolated versification of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s chapter 5, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> decided only later in <date when="1829">1829</date> to develop&#x2014;points to 
                        a fascination with <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s fifth chapter that was deeply entrenched in <date notBefore="1817-02-08" notAfter="1832-02-07"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s childhood</date>. 
                        Bridges had interested him since <date when="1823">1823</date>, when <persName corresp="#JRP">his aunt</persName> presented him with the cherished model of Waterloo Bridge (RFL, 127). 
                        The White Lady may have been associated in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mind with <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;witch of the waters at <geogName corresp="#ALPS">the Alps</geogName>&#x201D; in no. 3 (1826&#x2013;27), 
                        who occurs to Harry when he &#x201C;observed a rainbow and a rising mist under it which his fancy soon transformed into a female form&#x201D; 
                        (in book 3 of &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,&#x201D; the White Lady is a &#x201C;form appearing like a fog&#x201D;). Of course, these associations 
                        could just as likely have traveled the other way, with witches and bridges leading to his later fascination 
                        with the perils of the White Lady in &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p>If book 1 probes images that were profoundly arresting for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> throughout <date notBefore="1817-02-08" notAfter="1832-02-07">his earlier years</date>, 
                        books 2&#x2013;4 are enriched by a possible connection with the <date notBefore="1827-01-01" notAfter="1827-03-20">death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#JRP">Aunt Jessie of Perth</persName></date> 
                        and the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>s&#x02BC; subsequent adoption of her daughter <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> (see nos. 25&#x2013;26). 
                        Cousin <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> came to <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> in <date when="1828-07">July 1828</date> (TLC 7), an event that might well have put <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in mind of the two families joining 
                        in &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>&#x201D;&#x2014;the widowed Lady Avenel and her daughter Mary with the widowed Dame Glendinning and her two sons. 
                        In this light, the end of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem is moving, breaking off abruptly with the children&#x02BC;s sighting of the &#x201C;man in the spence,&#x201D; 
                        the ghost of Mary&#x02BC;s father, and the youngest boy&#x02BC;s tears&#x2014;events that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> slightly, and perhaps significantly, alters from the novel.</p>
                    <p>One other association may be noted, which returns the dating to early <date when="1829">1829</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> certainly fair&#x2010;copied books 3&#x2013;4, 
                        and probably composed at least some portion of them. It is striking that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> expressed admiration of her son equally for writing a &#x201C;novel&#x201D; 
                        and for making sermon notes (RFL 185). <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> did not necessarily consider these incompatible pursuits, as did some evangelicals, 
                        but she might have encouraged <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading of <hi rend="italic"><title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">The Monastery</title></hi>, owing to her opposition to <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Cathotic</orgName> Emancipation, 
                        being debated at the time (see RFL, 177). <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s novel makes heroes of the Reformers and satirizes monastic failings, 
                        although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem largely neglects these themes.</p>

                    <p>The copytext is taken from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. One peculiarity of punctuation, especially in the first two books, 
                        is the frequent use of a colon, which seems to indicate a pause, as does the two&#x2010;point ellipsis in &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>&#x201D; (no. 27). 
                        (In fact, that strange mark in &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">Eudosia</title>&#x201D; may be a colon turned on its side.) Perpetually inventive, in &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">The Monastery</title>,&#x201D; 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> has come up with yet another mark of his own, the upside&#x2010;down semicolon, or comma above a period. 
                        I cannot distinguish a consistent function for this mark much different from that of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s colon, so, where it appears, 
                        I have put a colon in square brackets.</p>
                    <p>With book 3, the punctuation becomes less idiosyncratic. The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft is entirely unpunctuated.</p>
