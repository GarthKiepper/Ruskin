                        based on his analysis of the sequence in which Ruskin entered poetry selections in MS III (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>; and see

                        <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> disagreed 
                        and ascribed the work to <date when="1827">1827</date>, in the belief that the poem was "a result of [Ruskin's] visit 
                        to Scotland in that year" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref> 2:260 n. 1; and see 276 n. 1). 
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Viljoen</persName> was initially inclined to accept the earlier date, because she considered the hand in the 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">IA</title> draft to be "very childish", but then she decided that 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> had "no legitimate basis" 
                        for correcting Collingwood's date of 1828 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VILJOENPAPERS">&#x201C;Helen Gill Viljoen Papers&#x201D;</ref>, box F, transcription of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>).</p>
                    
                    <p>The reasoning by the editors of the Library Edition does seem to stand on the most speculative evidence, 
                        dependent solely on Ruskin's comment in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title> 
                        that he "used to read the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTABBOT"><hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi></title> at Kinross, 
                        and the <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> in Glen Farg" 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1; 35:16). 
                        While Ruskin may well have associated Walter Scott's novels with landmarks along the Ruskins' routes to Scotland in the 1820s, 
                        why should these associations be tied so specifically to the journey of 1827? It is not known when Ruskin first read Scott's <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi></title> 
                        or heard it read to him. That journey did result, however, in the writing that immediately precedes Ruskin's "Monastery" 
                        in MS III--the anthology, <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry descriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        (see also <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date></ref>). 
                        Whether "The Monastery"--or at least its first Book--should be considered a contemporaneous part of that 1827 poetry project, 
                        or, as Collingwood contends, an insertion in that place from a later time, the poem's juxtaposition with an anthology of poems 
                        describing Lochleven and Glen Farg, among other places, does appear to confirm the associations that Ruskin commemorated in Praeterita.</p>
                    
                    <p>As explained in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, the only documented record 
                        of Ruskin's labor on <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> dates from March 1829, 
                        and even that passing reference in a letter is ambiguous. In the letter, Ruskin may refer to composition and/or fair copy of the poem itself, 
                        or he may simply be identifying MS III by its contents--the Red Book containing his versification, "The Monastery"--whereas 
                        his burst of activity on the notebook in March 1829 may not have included that poem at all. Based on the concatenation of evidence 
                        in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, however, it appears that Books I-II of the poem likely date from 
                        late 1827 or 1828, while Books III-IV--in fair copy, if not their composition--date from March 1829.</p>

                    <p>In <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                        immediately follows a group of poems entitled 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry descriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which Ruskin fair-copied no earlier than May 1827, and probably sometime between June 1827 and New Year's 1828 
                        (see <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="wales_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRWALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>; and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry descriptive&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>). 
                        Ruskin supplied no physical break between the anthology and the "novel" to indicate a change in genre or projects, 
                        so it is possible that he considered "The Monastery" as a continuation of the "poetry discriptive". 
                        However, the hand for the verse novel uses considerably smaller print lettering; and since 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had taken up pen and ink for the first time in April 1827, 
                        only shortly before he could have begun compiling "poetry discriptive", 
                        it is reasonable to conjecture that the two projects were separated by some of amount of time, with the fair copy 
                        of the verse novel benefiting from Ruskin's increased practice with a pen (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). 
                        The neglect of a physical separation does not necessarily imply, moreover, that Ruskin misunderstood the difference 
                        between the brief lyric mode of descriptive verse and a long narrative poem: from the outset of the fair copy, 
                        he divided <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> into numbered "books" 
                        that corresponded to chapters in Scott's novel&#x2014;a sequence that Ruskin could have extended to the end of the original story, 
                        but that he never carried beyond Scott's chapter four, so far as the record shows.</p>

                        that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was already familiar with some portion of the versified novel, 
                        so the first book or books may have significantly predated his "finishing" MS III. In fact, Ruskin's promise 
                        "to get that <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">red book</ref> of mine 
                        which has <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">the Monastery</title> in it finished" does not necessarily include a commitment 
                        to work on "The Monastery" itself, which is certainly not complete in any obvious sense. However, the physical disposition of the fair copy in MS III 
                        can be interpreted as reflecting two distinct stages of labor on the poem, with a break in time possibly occurring between books 1-2 and 3-4.</p>
                    
                    <p>In MS III, books 1-2 run from the last poem fair-copied in "poetry discriptive" to almost the end of the notebook (pp. 70-80), 
                        concluding with a colophon, "<hi rend="caps">END OF BOOK SECOND</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">HERNE HILL</hi> / <hi rend="smallcaps">DULWICH</hi>"; 
                        and then, with the direction "go back to page 52" inserted as part of the colophon, the poem resumes on page 52 with book 3, and extending through book 4, which seems uncompleted. 
                        The pages occupied by the latter two books (pp. 52-58, plus three blank pages, 59-61) take up the available leaves 
                        that fall between those containing a group of poems dated <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date> (pp. 36-50, plus the blank p. 51) 
                        and the leaves containing the <ref type="apparatus" target="poetrydiscriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry descriptive&#x201D;</title></ref> (pp. 62-70). 
                        In Ruskin's process of filling these interstitial leaves with books 3-4, the space occupied by "poetry discriptive" 
                        unquestionably presented a terminus ad quem of available space, while a terminus a quo was likely already present 
                        in the form of the March 9 poetry group. While the latter inference cannot be proven, since Ruskin could have decided arbitrarily 
                        to resume with book 3 on p. 52, with nothing in particular framing that space, the physical evidence does suggest 
                        that he composed and/or fair-copied at least books 3 and 4 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                        at about the same time that he was filling a preceding set of pages with a group of poems that he prominently and repeatedly dated <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date>. 
                        This frenzy of activity was meant to demonstrate, as he announced to his father on 10 March, that he would 
                        &#x201C;get that <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">red book</ref> of mine [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>] 
                        which has <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">the Monastery</title> in it finished, by the time you come home&#x201D;. (For the March 9 group, see its last-copied poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="of_rocks_first_and_of_caverns_now_i_sing_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JROFROCKSFIRST">&#x201C;Of rocks first and of caverns now i sing&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> includes a one&#x2010;sheet, ink, longhand set of lines that forms part of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> poem&#x02BC;s &#x201C;book third&#x201D;, 
                        as well as a one&#x2010;sheet pencil version of part of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> poem&#x02BC;s &#x201C;book second&#x201D; (see part 2, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msia_apparatus.php#content"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, &#x201C;Content&#x201D;</ref>, a). 
                        It is possible that the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> pencil version of part of &#x201C;book second&#x201D; is earlier than 1829, 
                        since the fair copy of &#x201C;book third&#x201D; is the portion positioned following the <date when="1829-03-09">March 9</date> group in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, 
                        while &#x201C;book second&#x201D; runs continuously to the end of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. Even the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> ink version of part of &#x201C;book third&#x201D;, conceivably, 
                        could significantly predate its <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date> fair&#x2010;copying.</p>
                    
                    <p>The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> copies, then, do hold open the possibility of a starting date perhaps up to a year prior to the project&#x02BC;s termination in <date when="1829">1829</date>. 
                        Moreover, given <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hectic pace of writing and fair&#x2010;copying for <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1828</date> and for <persName corresp="#JJR">his father</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1829-05-10">1829 birthday</date> (see nos. 32&#x2013;33, 57 <!--DCH--><ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;, Vol. III</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="a_battle_irregular_measure_apparatus"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRABATTLEIRREGULARMEASURE">&#x201C;A Battle: Irregular Measure&#x201D;</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" target="battle_of_waterloo_a_play_msv_apparatus.php"><title type="drama" corresp="#JRBATTLEOFWATERLOOPLAY">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts&#x201D;</title></ref>), 
                        it seems barely credible that even <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could have produced all of his &#x201C;novel&#x201D; during the same period. 
                        If these indications are sound, I believe the onset of composition is unlikely to have been much earlier than the <date notBefore="1828-05" notAfter="1828-08">middle of 1828</date>, however, 
                        since the handwriting and punctuation in the first two books is reminiscent of <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> (no. 27).<!--DCH--></p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Since the extant manuscript evidence places books 3&#x2013;4 of the poem (or, at least, their fair&#x2010;copying) squarely in <date when="1829">1829</date>, 
                        while only permitting an earlier date for books 1&#x2013;2, the case for assigning an earlier date to some portion of the poem must depend on internal evidence&#x2014;the events

See Discussion: since book 1 lifts events out of their order in <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY">Scott</title>, 
                        the poem could represent an earlier, isolated versification, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> only later in <date when="1829">1829</date> decided to develop&#x2014;&#x201C;commenc[ing] writing a novel&#x201D;, as <persName corresp="#MR">his mother</persName> said.</p>

                        a fascination with <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s fifth chapter that was deeply entrenched in <date notBefore="1817-02-08" notAfter="1832-02-07"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s childhood</date>.

                        could just as likely have traveled the other way, with witches and bridges leading to his later fascination

                        In this light, the end of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem is moving, breaking off abruptly with the children&#x02BC;s sighting of the &#x201C;man in the spence&#x201D;, 
                        the ghost of Mary&#x02BC;s father, and the youngest boy&#x02BC;s tears&#x2014;events that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> slightly, and perhaps significantly, alters from the novel.</p>
                    
                    <p>One other association may be noted, which returns the dating to early <date when="1829">1829</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> certainly fair&#x2010;copied books 3&#x2013;4, 
                        and probably composed at least some portion of them. It is striking that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> expressed admiration of her son equally for writing a &#x201C;novel&#x201D; 
                        and for making sermon notes (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 185). <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> did not necessarily consider these incompatible pursuits, as did some evangelicals, 
                        but she might have encouraged <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reading of <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>, owing to her opposition to <orgName corresp="#ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Cathotic</orgName> Emancipation,

                        although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem largely neglects these themes.</p>
