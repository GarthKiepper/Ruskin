                    leaving a vertical column measuring approximately nine lines of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cursive copperplate script, it is reasonable to assume that 
                    he intended to paste a drawing here, but never produced it, or that he produced a drawing, but it has been removed or lost.</p>
                    
                    <p>Evidence that Ruskin did produce a header vignette can be found in the catalogue of the <title type="exhibition" corresp="#RUSKINEXHIBITIONCONISTON1900">Ruskin Exhibition</title> 
                        held in Coniston, 21 July-8 September 1900. Item no. 10 in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900">Collingwood, <title type="catalogue" corresp="#WGCRUSKINEXHIBITION1900"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Exhibition</hi></title></ref>, 
                        is a drawing dated "about 1834", <title type="artwork" corresp="#JRHOTELDEVILLEBRUSSELSPROUTCOPY">Hotel de Ville, Brussels, after <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName></title>, 
                        which is described as a "copy" that Ruskin "reduced to miniature scale" from a larger drawing of the same subject. The latter drawing, also a copy after

                        is still extant in the Ruskin Library, Lancaster (6 3/4 x 4 1/4 inches, pen and ink, with pencil wash; RF 1449). The current location of the "miniature" shown at the exhibition is unknown; however, 
                        the most likely purpose for Ruskin to have reduced the larger drawing in 1834 would have been to fit the space above the the section header for <title type="composite" corresp="#JRBRUSSELSCOMP">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</title>.
