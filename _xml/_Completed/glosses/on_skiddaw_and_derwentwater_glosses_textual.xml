                    is the sole editor to read this word as &#x201C;vain&#x201D;, a reasonable interpretation of the letters formed by the awkward cursive hand in MS II. In the MS V fair copy, which was unavailable 
                    to Collingwood, the word used is unquestionably "fair"--and indeed, in context, that choice is more consistent with the "fancy's play" that does follow in subsequent lines. 
                    Ruskin rarely altered his initial word choices in fair copy, but it is possible that he did write "vain" initially, and then substituted the more logical "fair".</p></note>

                    fair copy (MS V) of the second line, Ruskin maintained singular case from the draft, but altered "the other" to "each other" ("And towers battlements and all appear / 
                    Chasing each other off and in their turn / Are chased by the others"). For the Spiritual Times, the second line was retained from Ruskin's fair copy, 
                    but otherwise the lines were considerably revised.The illusory fortresses in the clouds are elaborated with additional military spectacle, and then the figure 
                    of cloud watching launches a new simile comparing the actions of an "urchin boy" ("Towers, banners, spears, and battlements appear, / Chasing each other off; and in their turn / 
                    Are vanquished too, dissolving like the mould / That&#x02BC;s trampled by the foot of urchin boy").</p>
                    
                    <p>Collingwood--although following MS II, and not Ruskin's alteration in the fair copy--smoothes the grammar by changing the case to plural in the second line 
                    ("And towers, and battlements, and all appear / Chasing the others off, and in their turn / Are chas&#x00E8;d by the others"). 
                    In an example of Cook and Wedderburn's tendency to be influenced by Collingwood's version, the editors fold this grammatical correction ("the others") 
                    into their transcription of the Spiritual Times version, even though the latter adheres to Ruskin's fair-copy "each other" ("Towers, banners, spears and battlements appear / Chasing the others off; and in their turn / 
                    Are vanquished too . . ."). (In their transcription of the MS V version, Cook and Wedderburn do follow Ruskin's fair-copy choice, "each other", faithfully.) 
                    The Bookman version transcribes this passage in the Spiritual Times copytext accurately ("each other"), without inserting the alteration 
                    originating in Collingwood's text.</p></note>

                    although based on the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> draft, the editor omits the transition, 
                    &#x201C;But enough / Ive treated of the clouds&#x201D;; instead, he retains the end of the original line, but changes the verb tense&#x2014;from the imperative,

                    &#x201C;noble and grand and beutious clothed with green&#x201D;. While the omission was obviously <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s choice, 
                    it is possible that, working solely from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>, he misread &#x201C;come&#x201D; as &#x201C;came&#x201D;.</p>

                        The <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title> version, however, eliminates not only the transition but also the imperative 
                        (another invocation to the mountain occurs, after all, only seven lines later in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original version). 
                        Instead, this version elides the speaker&#x02BC;s cloud watching with a simile about the playful actions of the &#x201C;urchin boy!&#x201D;

                    of line 20 in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title> is barely legible, and the grammar strained, as the speaker changes perspective to lean into this detail: the "root" in line 19 is "straggling" in line 20 
                    "as it push its branches from the cliff". The revision overwritten in ink--the two lines, "a straggler. there as tho grow with stone for earth / 
                    and bare and scraggy as befit the cliff"--is scarcely clearer in its grammar, but one understands that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was shifting from the energy of "push" 
                    to the picturesque aspect of scragginess. Later in the draft, at line 37 (in the Derwent Water section of the poem), Ruskin returned to the overwritten line, recovering its energy in a more coherent version of the image: 
                    "A stragller pushes forth its branches stiff".<!-- CHECK LINE NUMBERS WHEN WITNESS PROCESSES --></p>
                    
                    <p>In the fair&#x2010;copy poem (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>), lines 20-21 present a clearer version of the two lines overwritten in ink in MS II: 
                        the "root" in line 19 of the draft has become a "bush", described as "A straggler with its roots fixed in the stone / And bare and scraggy as befits the soil". 
                        The draft's second occurence of the &#x201C;straggler&#x201D;--the line, "A stragller pushes forth its branches stiff"--no longer appears in the Derwent Water section or anywhere else in combination with "push". 
                        (It is possible, therefore, that in MS II Ruskin overwrote the draft with these lines at the time of fair-copying, not immediately after composing the rejected version in pencil.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Collingwood, in his version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSKIDDAW1891">&#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D;</title>, 
                        largely retained Ruskin's first thought about the image, but smoothed out the lines by combining portions of the MS II pencil draft and ink overwritten lines, 
                        and applied a verb tense that resulted in a comprehensible image: "A bare, terrific cliff precipitous / Descends, with only here and there a root, / 
                        A straggler, pushing forth its branches stiff". This version is ignored by the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> 
                        in its transcription of the MS V fair copy, instead adhering to Ruskin's final decision about the lines.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the revision made for the <title type="periodical" corresp="#SPIRITUALTIMES"><hi rend="italic">Spiritual Times</hi></title>, 
                        the word &#x201C;straggler&#x201D; does not appear at all; however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s image of tenacity 
                        (&#x201C;a bush&#x201D; or "root" "fixed" to the &#x201C;bare terrific cliff preciptate&#x201D;, 
                        surviving "in the stone / And bare and scraggy as befits the soil&#x201D;) is developed as part of a simile that connects this image 
                        with the preceding observation of changing cloud shapes. Here, the &#x201C;dissolving&#x201D; shapes 
                        are like the friable &#x201C;mould&#x201D; that is loosened by a mischievous &#x201C;urchin boy&#x201D;, who tramples the soil that had been 
                        &#x201C;bound&#x201D; by the &#x201C;roots tenacious&#x201D;. The idea of the pushing branches seems also present, suggested by the image 
                        of a root that, in the figurative sense of a &#x201C;spoiler&#x201D; (i.e., <hi rend="italic">despoiler</hi>), invades the hidden eagle nest. 
                        The pushing, however, has become clandestine.</p></note>

                    The solitary and deleted line below the title is not attributed to a speaker, and it does not appear in the play as fair&#x2010;copied; 
                    however, the line might represent a start on dialogue spoken by one of the French characters in the play. The fair copy of the play

                    use of "it" twice in the object position by fair-copying the MS II line without alteration in MS V, and Collingwood let the line stand (except by adding punctuation) 
                    in his version based on MS II. In the Spiritual Times version, the first "it" is omitted; rather than a mere error, however, the omission is supported by other alterations in the line 
                    that shift the referent of the first "he" from the boy to the snowman: ""And when he's made, he strikes it into ruin" (i.e., "And when [the snowman]'s made, [the boy] strikes it into ruin").</p>
                    
                    <p>Nicoll transcribed the line from the Spiritual Times accurately for the Bookman. Cook and Wedderburn, however, reinserted Ruskin's first "it" into the Spiritual Times version of the line: 
                        "Ane when he's made it, he strikes it into ruin". Thus, they shifted the referent of both instances of "he" back to the boy, while making the referent of the instances of "it" 
                        (now, again, two instances, as in Ruskin's original) refer to the snowman.</p></note>

                    to the version found in the fair copy, &#x201C;Which from thy mountain head doth fall&#x201D;, which is also correctly octosyllabic, but the line appears confused in the draft.
