                    by <persName corresp="#RHBC">Reginald Heber, bishop of Calcutta</persName> (1783-1826), which Ruskin and his mother were reading in March 1829, using volumes borrowed from a circulating library. 
                    Ruskin kept up his father on their reading in a <title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_jjr_1829-03-10">10 March letter</title>, 
                    reporting that they had followed Heber to "the Himmaleh those sublime mountains higher than chimborazo, 
                    the highest summit of the andes or cotopaxi the highest volcano"<!-- USE THESE SPELLINGS FOR ANDEAN MOUNTAINS BUT HIMALAYAS -->

                    Ruskin summarizes, Heber refers to the Himalayas as "the highest spots below the moon--and out-topping, by many hundred feet, the summit 
                    of Cotopasi and Chimborazo" (2:153).</p>
                    
                    <p>Heber's description of his first sighting of the Himalayas must stand among Ruskin's earliest exposures to this evangelical typological trope of the Pisgah sight, 
                        as applied to travel narrative. The description is also Romantic in its inquiry into the psychology of viewing the prospect. 
                        Heber is reminded of scenery in Wales--where the Ruskins had toured two years earlier

                                <p>I could not help feeling now, and I felt it still more when I began to attempt to commit the prospect to paper, 
                                    that the awe and wonder which I experienced were of a very complex character,
                                    and greatly detached from the simple act of vision. The eye is, by itself, and without some objects to
                                    form a comparison, unable to judge of such heights at such a distance. [The Welsh mountains] 
                                    Carneth Llewellyn [i.e., Carnedd Llewelyn] and Snowdon, at certain times in the year, make, really, as
                                    good a picture as the mountains now before me; and the reason that I am so much more impressed 
                                    with the present view, is partly the mysterious idea of aweful and inaccessible remoteness attached 
                                    to the Indian Caucasus, the centre of earth, "Its Altar, and its Cradle, and its Throne", 
                                    and still more the knowledge derived from books that the objects now before me are really among 
                                    the greatest earthly works of the Almighty Creator's hands.</p>
