                                <p>I could not help feeling now, and I felt it still more when I began to attempt to commit the prospect to paper, 
                                    that the awe and wonder which I experienced were of a very complex character,
                                    and greatly detached from the simple act of vision. The eye is, by itself, and without some objects to
                                    form a comparison, unable to judge of such heights at such a distance. [The Welsh mountains]

                                    good a picture as the mountains now before me; and the reason that I am so much more impressed 
                                    with the present view, is partly the mysterious idea of aweful and inaccessible remoteness attached

                                    and still more the knowledge derived from books that the objects now before me are really among

                    Roman city, destroyed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Excavations of the city along with Pompeii started in the early eighteenth century, 
                    but renewed digs drew attention especially to Herculaneum starting in 1828, and extending through the period of the composition, revision, and publication 
                    of Ruskin's poem. Earlier excavations at Herculaneum had consisted mainly in tunneling, removing antiquities, and backfilling, so that there was little 
                    to be seen of the city itself apart from the ampitheater, whereas the new initiative was aimed at laying bare entire structures 
                    such as what tourists were accustomed to viewing at Pompeii.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thus, Herculaneum was prominent in the news of the day; and since the reference occurs only in lines added to the 1830 Spiritual Times version 
                    of Ruskin's poem, the idea probably originated with Edward Andrews's interest in the recovered antiquities, which included a library of papyrus rolls 
                    found at Herculaneum that raised hopes of finding lost classical texts. These treasures, along with the imagined drama of the disaster, 
                    were themes of English poems about Herculaneum written in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, including one by Wordsworth. 
                    In particular, as a context for the lurid apocalyptic light that surrounds the reference added to Ruskin's poem, popular narratives of the 1830s 
                    invented a Christian community for Herculaneum and Pompeii, a sect imbued with the "purity" of the primitive church, and rescued from the Vesuvian punishment 
                    meted out to the decadent pagan civilization that ignored or persecuted the Christian call. Although too early for Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 
                    Last Days of Pompeii, which the Ruskins probably acquired in 1834, the year of its first publication, the Christian apocalypic story 
                    hinted in the Spritual Times version of Ruskin's poem could be found in predecessors to Bulwer-Lytton's novel. A popular form was a romance 
                    allegedly derived from the scrolls discovered at Herculaneum: one of these was authored by Ruskin's clergyman-mentor of the later 1830s, George Croly
