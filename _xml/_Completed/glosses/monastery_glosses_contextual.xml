                    (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>The opening six lines, an invocation of the White Lady to sing but not to harm, 
                    is apparently original to Ruskin. The rhetorical disjunction of the apostrophe from the narrative voice, which begins in line 7, 
                    perhaps had a precedent for Ruskin in the epigraphs that Scott introduces at the start of each chapter of his novels. The lines also suggest 
                    the singing of the White Lady herself, which is in couplets.</p></note>

                        (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>)&#x2014;</hi>Spelled <hi rend="italic">Glendearg</hi> 
                        in Scott's novel. Ruskin's misspelling partly confirms his later statement in Praeterita that "I used to read the 
                        <hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi> at Kinross, and the <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi> in Glen Farg, which I confused with 'Glendearg', 
                        and thought that the White Lady had as certainly lived by the streamlet in that glen of the Ochils, 
                        as the Queen of Scots in the island of Loch Leven" (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:16). 
                        That is, in the 1820s, when the Ruskins traveled to and from the city of Perth to visit Ruskin's Aunt Jessie and her family, 
                        they passed through <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="glenfarg_place_note.php">Glenfarg</ref>, 
                        which links Perthshire with Kinross and Loch Leven, where Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned--the historical background 
                        of <hi rend="italic">The Abbot</hi>, the sequel to <hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi>. Ruskin's spelling, <hi rend="italic">Glendarg</hi>, 
                        suggests, however, a willful conflation of Scott's fictional glen with the real <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="glenfarg_place_note.php">Glenfarg</ref>, 
                        rather than a confusion of the two places.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the introduction to the Magnum Opus edition of <hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi>, 
                        Scott denied basing the fictional glen on a real place, although admitting to a superficial resemblance to the 
                        Glen of Allan in the neighborhood of Melrose Abbey, on which he loosely based the Kennaquhair--the eponymous monastery of the novel
