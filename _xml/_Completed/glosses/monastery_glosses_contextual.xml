                    from which he controls two drawbridges extending to either side of the stream. For passage across the bridge,

                    of the text, and in part to his reversal of contents from Scott's chapters two and three, which play out events more logically. 
                    Walter Avenel was not killed in the Battle of Pinkie, as one might infer from Ruskin's version, but afterward. As Scott explains: 
                    "When Scotland began to recover from the dreadful shock she had sustained after the battle of Pinkie Cleuch, Avenel was one of the first who, 
                    assembling a small force, set a example in these bloody and unsparing skirmishes, which shewed that a nation, though conquered and overrun by invaders, 
                    may yet wage against them such a war of detail as shall in the end become fatal to the foreigners. In one of these, . . . Walter Avenel fell". 
                    Shortly after receiving this distressing news, Lady Avenel flees Avenel Castle with attendants on learning "that a party of Englishmen were coming to plunder the house and lands 
                    of [Avenel's] widow, in order by this act of terror to prevent others from following the example of the deceased". Whether or not this rumored party is identical 
                    to the force commanded by Stawarth Bolton, which has already visited the Tower of Glendearg in Scott's chapter two, all these raids issue from the English occupation 
                    following the victory at Pinkie; and the ongoing harrying by "English foragers" touches the Tacket farm, where Lady Avenel is concealed, costing "the few sheep 
                    which had escaped the first researches of their avarice". With no livestock for support, and surrounded by danger, Martin suggests they seek refuge 
                    at Glendearg Tower, since he has learned that Dame Glendinning "has had assurance from the Southron loons"--the episode that Ruskin transposes to this point in the narrative

                    which Halbert has contemptuously cast into the brook as the token of "a southern saint", because, Edward explains, 
                    "'the priest says it is the common sign of salvation to all good Christians'". Ruskin perhaps tips the scale of this ecumenical touch 
                    toward a Protestant emphasis, by appending reverence for "his blessed word" to Edward's explanation, 
                    recalling the monks' alarm over the heretical vernacular bible possessed by Lady Avenel. 
                    Ruskin also assigns words out of character to the English captain, whose parting exhortation is not to take care of the St. George's cross he has given the Glendinnings, 
                    but to "teach" the combative Halbert "'to spare women and children, for the sake of Stawarth Bolton'"

                    but which afforded to Martin only the sorrowful conviction, that the danger of their situation was about to be increased by a heavy fog". 
                    While Martin and Tibb do whisper the brief exchange that Ruskin paraphrases twenty lines later, about the danger of talking aloud about fairies, 
                    especially on this day of All-Hallow's Eve, 
                    Tibb does not allude to the White Lady in this episode, as Ruskin indicates. Rather, Ruskin appears to draw on a passage at the end of chapter 4, 
                    following the children's report of the supposed ghost of Walter Avenel, an episode that Ruskin mainly reserves for his book 4. 
                    Even in that passage in the novel, Tibb does not mention the location of the White Lady's haunt, but explains to Elspet Glendinning 
                    that "'great ancient families'" like the Avenels "'canna be just served wi' the ordinary saunts, (praise to them) 
                    like Saunt Anthony, Saunt Cuthbert, and the like, that come and gang at every sinner's bidding, but they hae a sort 
                    of saunts or angels, or what not, to themsels; and as for the White Maiden of Avenel, she is ken'd ower the haill country'". 
                    At the end of volume 1, Halbert Glendinning climbs to the fountain of a spring in the hills above Glendearg to summon 
                    the White Lady: "A huge rock rose in front, from a cleft of which grew a wild holly-tree [the emblem of the Avenels], 
                    whose dark green branches rustled over the spring which arose beneath. The banks on either hand rose so high, 
                    and approached each other so closely, that it was only when the sun was in its meridian height, 
                    and during the summer solstice, that its rays could reach the bottom of the chasm in which he now stood"

                    which has no counterpart in Scott's chapter. In these lines, Ruskin does not distinguish between the spirits' respective attributes vividly,

                    of Avenel Castle. To be like Christie would mean rough and serviceably, not splendidly, armed in gear that is dull with use (see, e.g., the description of Christie in vol. 1, chap. 9

                    In the novel, the boys report sighting only "an armed man", while it is Martin who supposes the man must be Christie, 
                    upsetting Lady Avenel, who fears more of Christie's bullying on behalf of his master. But the apparition that Mary later reports is not like Christie: 
                    she describes "'a gentleman with a bright breast-plate. . . . Black-haired, black-eyed, with a peaked black beard . . . 
                    and many a fold of pearling round his neck"; and perched on his hand, "a beautiful hawk, with silver bells . . . and a crimson silk hood 
                    upon its head". Tibb explains to Elspet that "'the lassie has seen her father!'"

                    <p>While Ruskin accurately conveys the alarm following the report of the armed man--Halbert arming himself with sword; 
                        Edward securing Lady Avenel's bible; Lady Avenel panicking over the whereabouts of Mary; and their collective rush to the spence, 
                        which turns out to be empty--he omits the crucial detail that they find Mary standing unperturbed at the door of the spence. 
                        In the novel, when asked where Christie has gone, she replies, "'I do not know . . . I never saw him'". 
                        Instead, Ruskin proceeds to Elspeth's scolding the boys; and in his final lines--with which he abandoned the project, 
                        at least on the evidence of extant text--he takes from Scott that Halbert "bent his eyes on the ground" while Edward "began to weep". 
                        In the novel, immediately following the boys' reaction to the scolding, Mary takes responsibility for the report, 
                        describing what she has seen. Ruskin's text falls just short of Mary's vision of the father
