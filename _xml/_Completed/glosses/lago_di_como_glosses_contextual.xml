                    for the family&#x02BC;s first excursion on the Italian lakes, apparently refers to <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName> rather than <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>, the main subject of the poem. 
                    In her travel diary for <date when="1833-06-14">14 June 1833</date>, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> records that the family left <placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName> at six o&#x02BC;clock in the morning 
                    for nearby &#x201C;Riva&#x201D;&#x2014;by which she must have meant what <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s guidebook identifies as 
                    &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName>, called also <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName>&#x201D;, 
                    and what <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s guidebook refers to simply as &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">La Riva</geogName>&#x201D;. 
                    Describing the journey in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> called the place &#x201C;the little recessed lake of Chiavenna&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:116).</p>
                    
                    <p>The Ruskins&#x02BC; carriage having been loaded on a large boat bound for the town of <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName>, the family took a passenger boat 
                    for <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName>, a village at the north end of <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lake Como</geogName>, which was accessible by water 
                    from <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName>. At <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName>, the family transferred to a steamer, 
                    and enjoyed the &#x201C;scenery changing constantly and beautiful&#x201D;, as <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> enthused, as they made their way down the long length 
                    of <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lake Como</geogName>. By four o&#x02BC;clock in the afternoon, they reached <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>, 
                    a town on the west bank at the top of the western &#x201C;leg&#x201D; of the lake, opposite <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName>; 
                    and since the steamer did not stop there, they took a small boat to <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName>, which they made their base for the weekend 
                    before traveling on to <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName> at the start of the next week 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson</title>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 42&#x2013;44;

                    <p>These movements are in keeping with the recommendations of the guidebooks. <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> cautioned travelers against pausing on their journey through these lakes, 
                        particularly &#x201C;the lower valley of the <geogName corresp="#MERA">Meira</geogName>&#x201D; (or <geogName corresp="#MERA">Mera River</geogName>), 
                        which connects &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName> to the <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName>&#x201D; 
                        (i.e., <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago di Mezzola</geogName>) and then continues onward to connect the latter to <geogName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>. 
                        Travelers should push onward, <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> urged, until reaching either <placeName corresp="#BELLAGIO">Bellagio</placeName> on the promontory 
                        dividing the lower legs of <persName corresp="LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</persName>, or <placeName corresp="#CADENABBIA">Cadenabbia</placeName> on the west shore, 
                        or <placeName corresp="#VARENNA">Varenna</placeName> on the east shore. Until travelers reached those points south, <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> 
                        sternly lectured, they risked contracting malaria: &#x201C;the stranger who neglects this warning may pay for his temerity by a fever&#x201D; since 
                        &#x201C;stopping for the night [anywhere] near the embouchure of a river, where it empties itself into a lake&#x201D;, exposes the traveler to &#x201C;the morasses 
                        and flat land created by the deposits of the river&#x201D;, which &#x201C;are the hotbeds of malaria, and inevitably teem with disease&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 212, xxiii). 
                        <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName>, in her guidebook, confirms a lesser detail in <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s account&#x2014;that a separate boat 
                        conveyed the family&#x02BC;s carriage from <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName> to <placeName corresp="#COMO">Como</placeName>, 
                        while the family took a small passenger boat, until joining a steamer at <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName>. <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName> mentions 
                        that the steamer concession at <placeName corresp="#DOMASO">Domaso</placeName> was &#x201C;managed by Englishmen&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE"><persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE"><hi rend="italic">Travels in Europe</hi></title></ref>, 568).</p>
                    
                    <p>As additional evidence that the location of the &#x201C;little peaceful bay / Beneath the precipices grey&#x201D;, where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> begins his poem, 
                        must have been on <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName>, the narrator mentions further on that, having &#x201C;launched from below / The shade of the tall cliffs&#x201D;, 
                        the family arrives, at line 20, where &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Como</placeName> rolled his breast of flame&#x201D;. 
                        <geogName corresp="#LAGORIVA">Lago di Riva</geogName> is indeed a place of cliffs coming down to the sea, and perhaps would have appeared even more dramatically so in <date when="1833">1833</date>, 
                        before a road was built around the perimeter of the lake. <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> mentions such a road as having opened in <date when="1835">1835</date>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;thousand mountain rills&#x201D; among these cliffs are likewise remarked by <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>: 
                        &#x201C;The naked and savage mountains around have a very peculiar outline. Their sides are furrowed with ravines, down which furious torrents precipitate themselves . . . , 
                        strewing the margin of the lake with wreck&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in Switzerland</hi></title></ref>, 212). 
                        The strategy of the poem is to contrast this severe scene with the blue <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Como</geogName> and its richly vegetated banks, 
                        which forms the subject of the remainder of the poem. Note that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not mention the steamer, describing only the splash 
                        of oars in the water. By confining his description to the gentle sounds of the excursion on the small passenger boat, he was erasing such signs of modernity 
                        as the noisy steam packet for the sake of maintaining the picturesque, just as in &#x201C;<title type="composite" corresp="#JRCALAISCOMP">Calais</title>&#x201D; 
                        he replaced the &#x201C;french steamer&#x201D; on the horizon with the picturesque, lugubrious movements nearby of French fishing boats.</p>
                    
                    <p>As detailed in the textual notes to this poem, <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> omitted the first ten lines of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft 
                        from the version of the poem in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title>, an omission that effectively erases the prelude 
                        describing <geogName corresp="#LAGOMEZZOLA">Lago Mezzola</geogName> and focuses the poem on <geogName corresp="#LAKECOMO">Lago di Como</geogName>.</p></note>
