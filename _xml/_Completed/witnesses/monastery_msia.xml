                        a band of english soldiers marched
                        close by the tower and as they passed
                        good dame glendinning her sons led

                        and I am at the mercy of your hand
                        the serjeant of the troop replied
                        though I have means of fighting on my side
                        I scorn with women now to strive
                        go to your tower again and live

                        the effects of my fathers sword on thee
                        why again god a mercy old stawarth did say
                        I see that alone I must go my way
                        but stay heres a token that if some men
                        come riding down this narrow glen
                        they may know that you are under my
                        protection then I say goodbye
