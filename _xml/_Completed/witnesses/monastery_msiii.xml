<l>has been reported of that place,</l>
<l>of the people of thy race.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="monastery_glosses_contextual.php#WHITELADYWHITELADYGLOSS"/></l>
<l>there was a river called the tweed,</l>
<l>where the sheep and cattle fed:</l>
<l>there was a drawbridge over the stream,</l>
<l>to let over travelling men,</l>
<l>that came down the narrow glen.</l>
<l>at the bridge there was a warder.</l>
<l>he lived in a lonly tower,</l>
<l>to let down the drawbridge when:</l>
<l>there came over travelling men,</l>
<l>but from them he exacted pay,</l>
<l>before he let them on their way.</l>
<l>one day a monk was going by,</l>
<l>to go home to his monastery:</l>
<l>the monk was forced to go to a ford,</l>
<l>he was not quite so rich as a lord,</l>
<l>he would not give the warder pay,</l>
<l>the warder told him to go that way.</l>
<l>when he came to the side of the stream,</l>
<l>where his mule was to go in,</l>
<pb facs="1229190"/>
<l>he saw a figure in great grief:</l>
<l>the monk resolved to give her relief,</l>
<l>she seemed as if to pass the water,</l>
<l>was her wish the cruel warder[:]</l>
<l>perhaps deprived her of her way,</l>
<l>but what it was she did not say.</l>
<l>she jumped upon his mule behind,</l>
<l>swifter even than the wind:</l>
<l>the mule did kick and plunge and leaped,</l>
<l>the monk did sit upon the beast and whipped:</l>
<l>at length she plunged into the river,</l>
<l>leaping oer a bunch of heather[:]</l>
<l>the ford was deep the current bore,</l>
<l>the mule along the winding shore.</l>
<l>the maiden then began to chaunt,</l>
<l>the stories of her avenel haunt:</l>
<l>which frightened still the monk much more,</l>
<l>as they swam along the winding shore.</l>
<l>they came at length to a water fall deep,</l>
<l>deeper een than a salmons leap,</l>
<l>the mule attempted on to go,</l>
<l>the abbot now was in great woe,</l>
<l>upon a black volume his hand he laid[:]</l>
<l>because he was much much afraid:</l>
<l>the maiden pitched him from the saddle,</l>
<l>out as well as he could to waddle:</l>
<l>and when he set his foot on land,</l>
<l>he sunk upon the yellow sand.</l>
<l>when the abbot did arise,</l>
<l>to behold the earth and skies,</l>
<l>home wards he did bend his way[:]</l>
<l>on a bed his head to lay.</l>
<l>but the monks around him crowd,</l>
<l>to hear his story told aloud,</l>
<l>and the first words he uttered then[:]</l>
<l>were the maidens song when in the glen.</l>
<l>the abbot did start when he heard the song,</l>
<l>and he said to his brother how long how long,</l>
<l>wilt thou keep up that spirits song</l>
<l>at length the monk did go his way,</l>
<l>to bed and glad he was to lay,</l>
<l>his head upon his pillow then,</l>
<l>we must return to the haunted glen.</l>
<l>the abbot when he first arose</l>
<l>which was when first the good cock crows,</l>
<l>he called good father eustace to:</l>
<l>his chamber and thus spoke to him lo.</l>
<l>our brother is no less than haunted,</l>
<l>with a spirit which to him chaunted:</l>
<l>some words which now we must not name,</l>
<l>lest open wide mouthed tattling fame:</l>
<l>should spread these curious news abroad,</l>
<l>and for the people pave the road,</l>
<l>to superstitions house to go:</l>
<l>and plunge them in a sea of woe.</l>
<l>now brother eustace go to the glen,</l>
<l>oer river bog or ford or fen,</l>
<l>and if a spirit shall arise[:]</l>
<l>and stand before your wondering eyes:</l>
<l>bring home the curious tale to me,</l>
<l>and i&#x02BC;ll believe what you do see.</l>
<l>the monk obeyed and off he rode,</l>
<l>before again the good cock crowed,</l>

<l>UP the glen a little way,</l>
<l>where a pretty meadow lay,</l>
<l>there was a tower upon the hill:</l>
<l>close beside the pretty rill.</l>
<l>at the battle of pinkie where,</l>
<l>the scotch fled like the frig{h}tened hare:</l>
<l>the owner of this tower expired,</l>
<l>rushed on his fate by anger fired:</l>
<l>the grey goose shaft did pierce him through,</l>
<l>to the rejoicing of the foe.</l>
<l>far from this tow&#x02BC;r there was a barons seat,</l>
<l>and woods and landscapes at its feet:</l>
<l>and the name of this baron was great avenel,</l>
<l>for the good of his country in battle he fell:</l>
<l>and his widow was left to provide for her child,</l>
<l>and beautiful was she and still more mild.</l>
<l>and farther on there was some land,</l>
<l>alotted to a farmers hand:</l>
<l>and the farmers name that did live there,</l>
<l>was martin and though they had but poor fare:</l>
<l>they were happy and good tibb tacket his consort,</l>
<l>would do every thing for her husbands comfort.</l>
<l>and the widow of avenel the baron did go,</l>
<l>away to this farmers for fear of the foe.</l>
<l>but shortly she staid there for soon came a band,</l>
<l>of english barbarians that plunder the land:</l>
<l>and they robbed the poor farmer of cow and of sheep,</l>
<l>and hardly would leave him poor shagram to keep.</l>
<l>now must we leave poor martin there,</l>
<l>while we relate the towers fare.</l>
<l>a band of english soldiers marched,</l>
<l>close by the tower and as they passed[:]</l>
<l>good dame glendinning her sons led,</l>
<l>out from the gate and thus she said.</l>
<l>no means of fighting have I on this land,</l>
<l>and I am at the mercy of your hand.</l>
<l>the serjeant of the troop replied,</l>
<l>though I have means of fighting on my side:</l>
<l>I scorn with women now to strive,</l>
<l>go to your tower again and live.</l>
<l>yet dame I own I envy you,</l>
<l>that little rogue with eyes so blue.</l>
<l>and will you come with me my lad,</l>
<l>the serjeant of the troop he said.</l>
<l>no said the blue eyed edward no,</l>
<l>because you are to us a foe:</l>
<l>not only that but then you are,</l>
<l>a heretic and fond of war.</l>
<l>why god a mercy old stawarth did say,</l>
<l>I see that alone I must go my way.</l>
<l>but stay thou black eyed come with me,</l>
<l>and many a fine sight thou shalt see.</l>
<l>no cried the furious halbert no,</l>
<l>because thou art to us a foe:</l>
<l>and when Im older thou shalt see,</l>
<l>the effects of my fathers sword on thee.</l>
<l>why again god a mercy old stawarth did say,</l>
<l>I see that alone I must go my way:</l>
<l>but stay heres a token that if some men,</l>
<l>come riding down this narrow glen:</l>
<l>they may know that you are under my,</l>
<l>protection then I say goodbye.</l>
<l>so saying from his bonnet he,</l>
<l>took a red cross and said dost see[:]</l>
<l>this token, here thou blackeyed boy,</l>
<l>take it and may it give thee joy:</l>
<l>give me thy bonnet off thy head,</l>
<l>the commander of the troop he said.</l>
<l>halbert was silent and would not stir,</l>
<l>more than the lofty towering fir:</l>
<l>command it to stir from the place where it stands,</l>
<l>and it will not without the help of hands:</l>
<l>but yet its green branches do wave in the wind,</l>
<l>and even so was proud halberts mind:</l>
<l>but from his head the mother snatched,</l>
<l>his cap at which young halbert catched:</l>
<l>but missed his aim the mother then,</l>
<l>gave it to the serjeant when:</l>
<l>he stuck the cross into the band</l>
<l>and put it in young halberts hand</l>
<l>no sooner had he done so but</l>
<l>young halbert with a furious look</l>
<l>took the cross and threw it in</l>
<l>the very pretty murmuring stream</l>
<l>young edward was instantly in the water</l>
<l>and brought it out safe to its rightful owner</l>
<l>why how now said the serjeant with some surprise</l>
<l>whats the reason of this my good blue eyes</l>
<l>that young rogue there throws it into the stream</l>
<l>and when he&#x02BC;s done so you leap in</l>
<l>and fetch it out and I demand</l>
<l>why you did throw it off the land</l>
<l>st georges cross and why did you</l>
<l>st Georges cross so soon pursue</l>
<l>because st george said halbert is</l>
<l>a southern saint, and the cross thats his</l>
<l>I will not wear in my bonnet or hat</l>
<l>why now said old stawarth I think that that</l>
<l>is a very good reason and why did you</l>
<l>st Georges cross so soon pursue</l>
<l>because the cross is the sign of our lord</l>
<l>and not only that but his blessed word</l>
<l>well good bye said old stawarth but theres the cross</l>
<l>if you lose it twill be a very great loss</l>
<l>so saying he rode down the glen</l>
<l>oer river bog or ford or fen1</l>

<l>I MUST return to martin now</l>
<l>whom I left standing in the bow</l>
<l>window of his cottage sweet</l>
<l>well to this tower they sped their feet</l>
<l>and martin and tibb tack did go</l>
<l>away to this tower for fear of the foe</l>
<l>and the widow of avenel with them did go</l>
<l>but between the tower and them</l>
<l>on the way to glendarg glen</l>
<l>there was a bog and oer this part</l>
<l>where even the lightfooted hart</l>
<l>go could not for his feet in clay</l>
<l>sunk as he sped him on his way</l>
<l>not only martin had to pass</l>
<l>but een good shagram with the lass</l>
<l>named mary avenel and when</l>
<l>they had come nearer to the glen</l>
<l>it was so bad that there they stuck3</l>
<l>for stir they could not een a foot</l>
<l>so martin took his task as guide</l>
<l>and all the women did in him confide</l>
<l>martin then did look about</l>
<l>to see where he could spy an out</l>
<l>let. then selecting the safest way</l>
<l>he to shagram began to say</l>
<l>come on good horse and let us see</l>
<l>whether thou wilt obey thy master me</l>
<l>come on but shagram would not go</l>
<l>though mute he very well said no</l>
<l>for shagram snorted laid his paws4</l>
<l>As if he encountered a great bears jaws</l>
<l>And would not go, Een tak your ain</l>
<l>Way said the shepherd I would fain</l>
<l>Get o&#x02BC;er to t&#x02BC;other side and be</l>
<l>Safe on our way so let us see</l>
<l>What you can do for us and when</l>
<l>We are safe at glendarg glen</l>
<l>Safe in stable you shall stand</l>
<l>With plenty hay and fodder at your hand</l>
<l>Just at this moment mary saw</l>
<l>Just as good shagram raised his paw</l>
<l>A beauteous lady far away</l>
<l>And seeing her she thus did say</l>
<l>I see a lady just up there</l>
<l>And I must say exceeding fair</l>
<l>Where where cried the whole of the family then</l>
<l>Why very near to glendarg glen</l>
<l>She signs to us to come yon gate</l>
<l>But it was great avenels fate</l>
<l>To have a spirit in their line</l>
<l>And so it was in this odd time</l>
<l>This tibb tacket thought it then</l>
<l>For twas near to glendarg glen</l>
<l>And her haunt was near this part</l>
<l>Where oft the very slender hart</l>
<l>Had drank at this place but was neer5</l>
<l>Frightened by her very fair</l>
<l>Form appearing like a fog</l>
<l>And this I suspect was that seen in the bog.</l>
<l>Shagram at his own free will</l>
<l>Did no longer stand stock still</l>
<l>But set off at [a or so]6 good rate</l>
<l>And then it was good shagrams fate</l>
<l>To take them safely through the bog</l>
<l>Indeed he did so though a fog</l>
<l>Oerspread the land. But worthy tis</l>
<l>Of remark that the little miss</l>
<l>Oft mentioned to the servants round</l>
<l>While they were still on boggy ground</l>
<l>The lady and her signals and</l>
<l>When they were off the boggy land</l>
<l>The servants changed expressive looks</l>
<l>With each other, for the nooks</l>
<l>Of fairies were supposed to be</l>
<l>Just in the glen and they thought they&#x02BC;d see</l>
<l>A fairy peeping out from moss</l>
<l>Or perhaps it might peep from a great morass</l>
<l>All halloween said tibby to</l>
<l>Martin. Woman you are too</l>
<l>Said martin or you would not dare</l>
<l>To speak of fairies ony mair.</l>
<l>When once more on firm ground they were</l>
<l>And had rid themselves of fear</l>
<l>Martin saw some landmarks high</l>
<l>Upon a hill against the sky</l>
<l>And taking them for his good guide</l>
<l>And ever keeping by their side</l>
<l>Very soon at the tower of glendarg they arrived</l></lg></div>

<l>ONE night when all the winds combined</l>
<l>To frighten een the strongest mind</l>
<l>And halloween it was and all</l>
<l>The fairies seemed and elves to call</l>
<l>In the loud wind that roared round</l>

<l>Mary of avenel halbert and all</l>
<l>Were allowed to run up and down the hall</l>
<l>There were some rooms adjacent to</l>
<l>The hall where sometimes they would go</l>
<l>I mean the children and at length</l>
<l>Into these rooms they all were sent</l>
<l>But from them openmouthed there came</l>
<l>To spread abroad the ghost like fame</l>
<l>The boys and they indeed did tell</l>
<l>That a man like he of the clinthill</l>
<l>Was in the spence. then Alice said</l>
<l>Where is my child and so she led</l>
<l>Halbert glendinning first to arm</l>
<l>With an old sword his open palm</l>
<l>And Edward seized the ladys book</l>

<l>And then unto the spence they went</l>
<l>When their alarm soon from them went</l>
<l>For no man armed there appeared</l>
<l>And what made you ye false misleard</l>
<l>Said good dame elspeth to her bairns</l>
<l>And what made you ye misleard loons</l>
<l>Come there yon gate into the hall</l>
<l>Roaring I am sure like a bull</l>
<l>And could ye find nae night for daffing</l>
<l>Save halloween when the leddy was reading</l>
<l>The elder boy bent eyes on ground</l>
<l>With the youngest tears their access found.7</l>
