      <div class="title">Henry D. Inglis (1795&#x2013;1835)</div>
      
      <p>Travel writer and editor. Born in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> formed part of the Scottish literary circle in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                    a circle with which the Ruskin family enjoyed contact in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John</span> was first entering the publishing scene. 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> was related on both his father&#x02BC;s and mother&#x02BC;s sides to writers and artists, including a connection by marriage to the important 
                    Scottish portrait painter, <span class="persName-SHR">Sir Henry Raeburn</span> (1756&#x2013;1823)

                    which were revised from their original versions as fair&#x2010;copied in

                    and which were paired under the title, <span class="title-peom-FRAGMENTS">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal,&#x201D;</span> for publication in the annual. 
                    This volume of <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a> 
                    also contains a poem composed originally for the annual, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;<span class="title-poem-SALTZBURG">Saltzburg</span>&#x201D;</a>.

      <p>It is unlikely, however, that <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> had much to do with the commissioning and revision of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems. 
                    For much of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when this volume of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> was in preparation, 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> was abroad, preparing a travel book, 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#INGLISIRELAND" target="_blank" class="inactive">Inglis, <span class="title-guidebook-"><i>Ireland in 1834</i></span></a>&#x2014;a tour, 
                    according to the book&#x02BC;s subtitle, that occupied the author during the &#x201C;spring, summer, and autumn&#x201D; of that year. 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> dated the book&#x02BC;s dedication from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, <span class="date-1834-11"> November 1834</span> (p. vi), which would have been about the time that 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath . . . for MDCCCXXXV</i></a> 
                    was released for public sale. It is more likely that the editing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems remained in the hands of 
                    <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</a>, 
                    who was editor of the annual <span class="date-1828-1834-12">from 1828 until his death in December 1834</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>With the onset of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s tuberculosis in late <span class="date-1834-06">June 1834</span>, <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> did step into the breach at some point in the <span class="date-1834-07-1834-12">second half of the year</span> in order to help oversee the annual. 
                    As <a href="../notes/harrison_w_h_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">W. H. Harrison (ca. 1792&#x2013;1878)</a> explains in the preface to 
                    <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> for <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, which he took over following <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>&#x02BC;s own death in <span class="date-1835-03">March 1835</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> &#x201C;assisted&#x201D; <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> &#x201C;in the last year&#x201D; of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s editorship 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1836" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath . . . for MDCCCXXXVI</i></a>, v). 
                    It was apparently a longstanding friendship that enabled <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> in his last days to rely on <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>, who, according to <span class="persName-RV">Randolph Vigne</span>, 
                    had in his turn benefited from <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s support when making his way in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary life. 
                    Their acquaintance extended back to university days at <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> reports&#x2014;though, 
                    if so, <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> would have been a youth who was <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s junior by six years 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 16).
      </p>
      
      <p>Much of <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span>&#x02BC;s assistance must have been directed at the volume for <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, since <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> sent the volume for <span class="date-1835">1835</span> to press in <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span>  
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 244). 
                    Before being absolutely forced by declining health to give up work, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> could not have afforded to resign his editorial post. 
                    As he commented in a letter of <span class="date-1834-10">October 1834</span>, in which 
                    he pleaded for financial help in order to move to a warmer climate, 
                    he &#x201C;was utterly . . . without income, except what depended on &#x005B;his&#x005D; pen&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RITCHIEMEMOIRSPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ritchie, <span class="title-memoir-PRINGLEMEMOIRS">&#x201C;Memoirs of Thomas Pringle&#x201D;</span></a>, cxix; 
                    and see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 246). 
                    
      </p>
      
      <p>There is one possible connection between <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composition of the poem, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;<span class="title-poem-SALTZBURG">Saltzburg</span>&#x201D;</a>. Whereas the Ruskin family first visited the Austrian city 
                    during the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1835" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1835</a>, too late for any influence on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> had traveled to <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span> and written about his experiences in <span class="title-memoir--italic">The Tyrol; with a Glance at Bavaria</span> (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>). 
                    <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> did not consider there to be &#x201C;much in <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span> to detain the traveller long,&#x201D; however, and nothing in his published account suggests a possible source for details in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#INGLISTYROL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Inglis, <span class="title-INGLISTYROL"><i>The Tyrol</i></span></a>, 270, and see 269&#x2010;71). 
                    If there was a contact between <span class="persName-HDI">Inglis</span> and the Ruskins&#x2014;or contact via <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x2014;he might personally have communicated some ideas about <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span>, 
                    including the dubious information that the patron saint of <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span>, <span class="persName-STRUPERT">St. Rupert</span>, &#x201C;was by birth a Scotchman,&#x201D; according to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s note to his poem. 
                    This notion was available in the <span class="title-HISTORIA"><i>Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum</i></span> by <span class="persName-TDSCHOLAR">Thomas Dempster</span> (<span class="date-1579-1625">1579&#x2013;1625</span>), 
                    which had been republished in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, as an expression of the enthusiasm for Scottish antiquarianism associated with
