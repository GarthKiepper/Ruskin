      <p>While the Ruskins had crossed the <span class="placeName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span> for the modest <a href="../notes/tour_of_1825_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1825</a> 
                    to view <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span> battlefield, <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, and <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, 
                    their first ambitious tour of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> occurred <span class="date-1833-05-10-1833-09-22">between May and September 1833</span>. 
                    The tour therefore fell only a few years after the <span class="date-1830-07-26-1830-07-29">July Revolution</span> in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> 
                    and the <span class="date-1830-08-25-1831-07-14">Belgian Revolution of 1830</span>.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>The Ruskin traveling party included, besides <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his parents, 
                    his cousin, <a href="../notes/richardson_mary_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></a>, 
                    and his nurse, <a href="../notes/strachan_ann_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-ASB">Anne Strachan</span></a>. 
                    On the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>, they enjoyed the services of a cicerone, named <a href="../notes/salvador_note.php" target="_blank">Salvador</a>; 
                    and in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, as in <span class="date-1825">1825</span>, the family benefited from the rapid rise of efficent and inexpensive travel to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> by steam. 
                    For these developments in travel across the <span class="placeName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</span>, which the Ruskins enjoyed 
                    along with thousands of middle&#x2010;class <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span> travelers in the decades after the <span class="date-1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</span>, 
                    see <a href="../notes/tour_of_1825_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1825</a>. 
                    In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, steam packets departed daily between <span class="date-1833-04-1833-11">April and November</span> for <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> 
                    from the <span class="placeName-TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</span>, and five days per week from <span class="placeName-DOVER">Dover</span>, 
                    which was where the Ruskins boarded. Traveling to <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> in the same year as the Ruskins, 
                    <span class="persName-FMT">Frances Trollope</span> (<span class="date-1769-1863">1779&#x2013;1863</span>) found that her steam vessel was &#x201C;dirty, and the fare both bad and insufficient,&#x201D; 
                    especially for the &#x201C;many children aboard&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TROLLOPEBELGIUM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Trollope, <span class="title-guidebook-TROLLOPEBELGIUM-italic">Belgium and Western Germany in 1833</span></a>, 1:2) 
                    In contrast, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span>, proud that the Ruskin family &#x201C;went by English packet (not French),&#x201D; 
                    commented that there were &#x201C;not many passengers but all kept well&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFT48" target="_blank" class="inactive">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</a>, p. 1).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Besides relying on their courier, <a href="../notes/salvador_note.php" target="_blank">Salvador</a>, the Ruskins carried guidebooks, 
                    which in the <span class="date-1820-1835">1820s through the mid&#x2010;1830s</span> were undergoing a transition. 
                    The vade mecum for <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">English</span> travelers landing in <span class="placeName-NORMANDY">Normandy</span> 
                    and the Low Countries, <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836-italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</span></a>, 
                    did not become available until <span class="date-1836">1836</span>. Whereas <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836-italic">Hand&#x2010;book</span> is now often credited with founding the genre of the modern <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">English</span> traveler&#x02BC;s guidebook, 
                    for earlier journeys like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, taken after the reopening of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> following the <span class="date-1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</span> in  
                    <span class="date-1815-1836">1815 and continuing through the mid&#x2010;1830s</span>, travelers relied on publications that combined personal travel narrative with some practical advice. 
                    As <span class="persName-PF">Pieter François</span> has shown, in the period prior to the publication of <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836-italic">Hand&#x2010;book</span>, 
                    there appeared numerous examples of the guidebook genre, particularly relating to the Low Countries, but in an emergent and somewhat inchoate form. 
                    Only gradually, after <span class="date-1815-06-18">Waterloo</span>, the modern guidebook emerged as a genre distinct from the so&#x2010;called 
                    <i>travel account</i>, in that the guidebook came to offer mainly practical travel advice, 
                    whereas the more traditional travel account emphasized topographical description and narrative from an individual perspective 
                    (albeit not too individualistic, lest decorum and authority seem to succumb to eccentricity). In the immediate  period, 
                    these genres were often mixed in the same book, with traces of the eighteenth&#x2010;century travel account governing the narrative (for example, in the adoption of an epistolary form), 
                    while tables of practical advice were added to recommend the book in a crowded field 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815" target="_blank" class="inactive">François, <span class="title-article-FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s 1815, This Must Be Belgium&#x201D;</span></a>, 76&#x2013;82).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>This transitional and eclectic period of travel writing is reflected in the Ruskins&#x02BC; book purchases, 
                    both before setting out on their <span class="date-1833">1833</span> journey and following their return. Besides arming themselves with a <span class="placeName-GERMANY">German</span> grammar book, 
                    the Ruskins carried a work by <span class="persName-MSA">Mariana Starke</span> (<span class="date-1762-1838">1762&#x2013;1838</span>), 
                    whose travel books both <span class="persName-PF">François</span> and <span class="persName-JB">James Buzard</span> characterize as typical of the transitional period 
                    of travel writing, displaying characteristics both of the guidebook and the travel account, 
                    and whose work <span class="persName-CB">Charles Batten</span> similarly describes as moving away from the decorum of the eighteenth&#x2010;century travel account 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815" target="_blank" class="inactive">François, <span class="title-article-FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s 1815, This Must Be Belgium&#x201D;</span></a>, 76, 90;

                    The <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span> work acquired by the Ruskins may have been <span class="title-guidebook-STARKETRAVELS-italic">Travels in Europe</span>, a popular guidebook first published by 
                    <span class="orgName-MURRAY">Murray</span> in <span class="date-1820">1820</span> as <span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYTRAVELLERS1820-italic">Travellers on the Continent</span>, 
                    and available in a &#x201C;considerably enlarged&#x201D; eighth edition in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>.
                
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-MSA">Starke&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-guidebook-STARKETRAVELS-italic">Travels in Europe</span> along with her more portable <span class="title-guidebook-STARKEDIRECTIONS-italic">Information and Directions for Travellers on the Continent</span>, 
                    which was published on the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> by Galignani, approached closely, <span class="persName-JB">Buzard</span> remarks, 
                    to the form of the modern guidebook. Even <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span>&#x02BC;s much earlier success, <span class="title-guidebook-STARKEITALY-italic">Travels in Italy</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1800">1800</span>), had been &#x201C;felt by many before the rise of the <span class="orgName-MURRAY">Murray</span> 
                    and <span class="orgName-BAEDEKER">Baedeker</span> guides to be the best available vade&#x2010;mecum for <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>.&#x201D; 
                    This work, <span class="persName-JB">Buzard</span> says, &#x201C;was by no means single&#x2010;mindedly devoted to the role of &#x2018;handbook.&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    It was characteristic of the transitional period of travel writing, in having &#x201C;the appearance, 
                    when we look back at it with generic presuppositions founded on <span class="orgName-MURRAY">Murray</span> and <span class="orgName-BAEDEKER">Baedeker</span>, 
                    of an impressionistic &#x2018;travel book&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, as still relying, despite its &#x201C;serving as a makeshift &#x005B;modern&#x005D; &#x2018;handbook&#x2019; 
                    in the absence of any alternative,&#x201D; on such eighteenth&#x2010;century conventions as a series of letters containing the traveler&#x02BC;s personal impressions 
                    balanced by judicious reflection (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BUZARDBEATEN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Buzard, <span class="title-book-BUZARDBEATEN-italic">Beaten Track</span></a>, 68, and see 69&#x2013;70).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Comparatively compendious as <span class="title-guidebook-STARKETRAVELS-italic">Travels in Europe</span> was, the guide offered no advice on the route from 
                    <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> to <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>, which the Ruskins followed in order to access the 
                    <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span>; for while <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span>&#x02BC;s updated guide did supply information on 
                    <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> and many other regions of Europe in an appendix, the main text remained traditionally focused on getting the traveler 
                    first to <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>, and then to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. Once arrived in the South, however, 
                    the Ruskins would have found <span class="persName-MSA">Starke</span>&#x02BC;s work handy for its more modern, guidebook&#x2010;like feature 
                    of convenient &#x201C;catalogues of the most valuable specimens of Architecture, Painting, and Sculpture, in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, 
                    <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, <span class="placeName-MAGNAGRAECIA">Magna Graecia</span>, <span class="placeName-SICILY">Sicily</span>, 
                    and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>; with the opinions of Nardini, Venuti, Winckelmann, and Visconti, 
                    on some of the most celebrated Works of Art&#x201D;

         <p>Once arrived in <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, the Ruskins would have stayed at one of the well&#x2010;established inns, 
                        while transacting business such as seeing their luggage through customs, and paying a deposit for their carriage at the custom house 
                        (see a guidebook probably used by the Ruskins on this journey, <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STARKETRAVELSINEUROPE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Starke, <span class="title-guidebook-STARKETRAVELS-italic">Travels in Europe</span></a>, 526&#x2013;28). 
                        From <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, the Ruskins followed the route that, a few years later in <span class="date-1836">1836</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836-italic">Hand&#x2010;book</span> confirmed as the shortest route from <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> 
                        to <span class="placeName-">Brussels</span>, by way of <span class="persName-LILLE">Lille</span>. Including a lengthy stop in <span class="placeName-LILLE">Lille</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>&#x02BC;s guidebook calculates, the journey to <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> by diligence would have required about twenty&#x2010;four hours 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836-italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</span></a>, 84&#x2013;85). 
                        In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s travelogue, <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>,

         </p>
         
         <p>In this passage through what had once been French&#x2010;speaking <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span> (and that now formed the departments of the Nord and the Pas de Calais in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>) and 
                        through the heart of the newly formed nation of <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, the Ruskins observed a region that had suffered a long history of contestation beteen nations, 
                        but that was now catching up with modern industrialization. <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain&#x02BC;s</span> superiority in industrial development, as compared with that in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, 
                        remained an article of faith on both sides of the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span>; however, British perception of <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> was undergoing a transformation, 
                        with Tory suspicions of the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>&#x02BC;s revolutions subsiding in favor of a whiggish view of <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> as a &#x201C;little Britain&#x201D; of industrial prosperity, 
                        constitutionalism, rationalism, and even (the British persuaded themselves) an ersatz Protestantism 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STEARNSBRITISHINDUSTRY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Stearns, <span class="title-article-STEARNSBRITISHINDUSTRY">&#x201C;British Industry through the Eyes of French Industrialists&#x201D;</span></a>; and

                        <span class="persName-FMT">Mrs. Trollope</span> urged the &#x201C;whole of the British nation&#x201D; to &#x201C;feel a deep and affectionate interest for the amiable prince &#x005B;<span class="persName-LGCF">Leopold I</span>, <span class="date-1790-1865">1790&#x2013;1865</span>&#x005D; 
                        who has been induced to accept the throne of <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>. It is impossible to forget how near he has been to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>,&#x201D; she effused, 
                        referring to his marriage to the late Princess Charlotte (<span class="date-1796-1817">1796&#x2013;1817</span>), which had once put him in line to become prince consort to a successor of the English throne. 
                        Still, <span class="persName-FMT">Mrs. Trollope</span> considered <span class="persName-LGCF">Leopold</span>&#x02BC;s position to be false, since the citizens of the new Belgian nation remained &#x201C;unresistingly shackled&#x201D; 
                        by their Catholic culture on the one hand, while &#x201C;a club or a dagger &#x005B;was&#x005D; put by law into the&#x005B;ir&#x005D; other&#x201D; hand by the new constitution: 
                        &#x201C;Nothing can present a stranger anomaly in human affairs than the sight of a nation, deeply and severely Catholic, 
                        attempting to ape the chartered libertinism of political thinking, which a few noisy and discontented persons are endeavouring to teach them. 
                        The law which authorizes unrestrained license of tongue and pen, both public and private, on all subjects, whether political or religious, 
                        accords ill with the principles of a people whose religion commands them to bring their thoughts, words, and deeds before the tribunal of their priests&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TROLLOPEBELGIUM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Trollope, <span class="title-guidebook-TROLLOPEBELGIUM-italic">Belgium and Western Germany in 1833</span></a>, 1: 52, 55).

         <p>That the Ruskins agreed with these ambivalent views is evident in the flashes of anti&#x2010;Catholicism and comments on the mercantile inferiority of the region 
                        that pepper <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems (see e.g., <a href="../witnesses/cassel_poem_msix.php">&#x201C;Cassel&#x201D;</a> and

                        unfortunately is missing its account of the initial stages of the tour, but entries made on the return home focus on what he considered the bleakness and squalor in the region: 
                        &#x201C;How uninteresting is all the Country from <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span> down to <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> so monotonous&#x2014;so open so naked&#x2014;. . . one vast dreary dry &#x0026; weary way.&#x201D; 
                        Of French manufacture in <span class="placeName-LYONS">Lyon</span> (the family passing through the city between the revolts by silk&#x2010;workers in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> and <span class="date-1834">1834</span>), <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> noted how 
                        &#x201C;smoky &#x0026; black&#x201D; and crowded the tenements were. Yet he was also capable of comparing the French weavers favorably with their British counterparts: 
                        &#x201C;Amongst our poor weavers there is everything to depress to degrade to debauch &#x0026; brutalize,&#x201D; 
                        whereas &#x201C;the objects round&#x201D; the French workers&#x2014;the &#x201C;grander Houses the distant <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> the clear blue sky&#x201D;&#x2014;perhaps exert

                        these topical issues emerge in passing, but the work is largely untroubled by modern turmoil. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions battlefields, but his references tend to be unspecific, as likely medieval as modern. He prefers the picturesque over the political, 
                        the emphasis reflecting how, in the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>, views of northern Europe were opened up as vividly by artists and poets as by military news. 
                        It is striking how <span class="persName-FMT">Mrs. Trollope</span>, traveling through the region in the same year as the Ruskins, describes scenes by referencing the artist

                        &#x201C;A walk through the fine old streets&#x201D; of <span class="placeName-BRUGES">Bruges</span>, &#x201C;with their high pointed mansions, and richly carved ornaments, 
                        is like looking over a portfolio of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s best drawings&#x201D;. She recognizes the  
                        &#x201C;mellowed tints of red and grey&#x201D; in <span class="placeName-HUY">Huy</span> as having been &#x201C;so dear to <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x201D;

                        To traverse the region, the Ruskins would have received only limited help from the recently updated guidebook by <span class="persName-MSA">Mariana Starke</span> 
                        that they probably carried; nonetheless, they managed to follow a path similar to that taken in <span class="date-1821">1821</span> by <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>, 
                        whose <span class="date-1833">1833</span> <span class="title-collected_sketches-PROUTSKETCHES-italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span> and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span></span> 
                        helped inspire the family&#x02BC;s tour. The influence of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> specifically in relation to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is treated in
