      <div class="title">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</div>
      
      <p>The earliest extant sustained writing by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiva_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIVA">MS IVA</span></a>, dated 1826&#x2013;27, which
                    he wrote entirely in print lettering. The medium is graphite, for which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably would have used a porte&#x2010;crayon&#x2014;a metal holder for rods of plumbago&#x2014;or 
                    he might have used a cedar pencil. The plumbago used in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> was proudly mined in <span class="placeName-BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</span>, 
                    where high quality deposits were carefully husbanded 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FINLAYWESTERNWRITINGIMPLEMENTS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Finlay, <i>Western Writing Implements</i></a>, 52&#x2013;53). 
                    The porte&#x2010;crayon is a typical object in eighteenth&#x2010;century genre paintings showing boys absorbed in drawing, 
                    such as works by the French artists <span class="persName-JSC">Jean Sim&#x00E9;on Chardin</span> (1699&#x2013;1779), 
                    <span class="persName-JBG">Jean&#x2010;Baptiste Greuze</span> (1725&#x2013;1805), and Nicolas&#x2010;Bernard L&#x00E9;pici&#x00E9; (1735&#x2013;84),
                    who were concerned with conveying progressive educational ideas and with representing children as thoughtful, individualistic observers 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JOHNSONPICTURINGPEDAGOGY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Johnson, &#x201C;Picturing Pedagogy&#x201D;</a>).
                
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based his print lettering in part on models found in his favorite books. For example, in his adaptation of 
                    <span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">Early Lessons</span>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, 
                    he imitated the original&#x02BC;s title page; and his lettering generally suggests the influence of English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer,  
                    and their predecessor, Caslon, which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
                    Even in these first manuscripts, the <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Books</a>, however, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also flourished his lettering with decorative capitals that 
                    in the 1828&#x2013;29 <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol3_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3</span></a>, 
                    he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. 
                    The style of this lettering appears based on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the 1780s 
                    and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC" target="_blank" class="inactive">Cramsie, <span class="title-CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><i>Story of Graphic Design</i></span></a>, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                    One likely model for his &#x201C;double&#x201D; lettering was the largest, most prominent labeling used for maps in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s geography book, 
                    <span class="title-map-GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><i>Geography Illustrated on a Popular Plan</i></span> by the <span class="persName-RJG">Rev. J. Goldsmith</span> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>). 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-collected_works-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:79)
      </p>
      
      <p>According to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first used pen and ink around <span class="date-1827-04-28">28 April 1827</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 156; 
                    see also <span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</span>, n. 8). 
                    These fledgling efforts with pen and ink are best exhibited in <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-">MS III</span></a>. Its inside
                    back endboard is covered with random words and letters in ink, as if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was
                    practicing use of his pen. In that same year, when entering the first works to be fair&#x2010;copied in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>&#x2014;that is, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</span></a>, and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">Poetry Descriptive</span></a>&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    traced his letters in ink over top of his initial pencil lettering, 
                    which remains visible beneath. (A clearly visible example of the procedure is found in line 1 of 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                    where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left the terminal <i>s</i> 
                    of the word <i>beauties</i> in pencil, forgetting to overwrite that one letter in ink.) 
                    Also, the drawings for this <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a> are in pencil, while 
                    their legends written in ink. A similar mix occurs in a <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> letter to his father, 
                    the text of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote in pencil, but which included two poems fair&#x2010;copied in ink, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/wales_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</span></a> and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-collected_letters-RFL-italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></a>, 159 n. 1). By 
                    <span class="date-1828-1829">1828&#x2013;29</span>, when fair&#x2010;copying 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/the_monastery_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-THEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</span></a> in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, he had perfected a tiny ink lettering, free of
                    pencil tracing underneath. Another transitional piece is 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/look_at_that_ship_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; <i>and</i> &#x201C;Look at that Ship&#x201D; &#x005B;1827&#x005D;</a>,
                    which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> lettered in pencil in the &#x201C;feb / march 1827&#x201D; version, 
                    and in ink in the <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> version
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> 
                    provide a reliable guide. In <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                    and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> 
                    also witnessed the mass production of steel pens, and by <span class="date-1838">1838</span> this output increased to 220 million. Also by the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                    manufacturers were perfecting quill nibs for use in pen holders, 
                    and improvements in quill fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                    <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                    consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                    preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one

      <p>Contemporaneously with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first efforts at writing in ink, in <span class="date-1827-06">June 1827</span> his father purchased

                    <a href="../notes/butterworth_e_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-EDB">Edmund Butterworth</span> (d. 1814)</a>. 
                    <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> held the post of writing master and accountant at the <span class="orgName-RHSE">Royal High School</span>, <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, 
                    until <span class="date-1793">1793</span>, 
                    shortly before <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> enrolled at that institution in <span class="date-1795">1795</span>. At age ten, 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was already somewhat older than his class, 
                    the customary starting age at the <span class="orgName-RHSE">High School</span> being eight. (While the <span class="orgName-RHSE">High School</span> was fiercely republican 
                    in seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, 
                    the Ruskin family probably needed extra time to scrape together money for the fees, or they may have been apprehensive of exposing <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> to a famously sadistic Latin master 
                    &#x005B;see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Viljoen, <i>Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</i></a>, 59&#x2013;62&#x005D;.) 
                    Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, at age eight, 
                    to copybook exercises by his alma mater&#x02BC;s writing master. By this age, in 1826&#x2013;27 John had already begun practicing (in pencil)

                    <a href="../apparatuses/msja_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS Juvenilia A</a>. Just so, at the <span class="orgName-RHSE">High School of Edinburgh</span>, boys drilled 
                    for five to six years in Latin lessons (and some Greek in the fifth year) as a foundation for entry to the universities, where at age thirteen or fourteen they began training 
                    for professions, most often for the law (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Viljoen, <i>Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</i></a>, 59&#x2013;61). 
                    It is impossible to view the <span class="date-1804">1804</span> <span class="title-painting-RAEBURNPORTRAITJJR-italic">Portrait of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span></span> 
                    by <span class="persName-SHR">Henry Raeburn</span> (1756&#x2013;1823)&#x2013;an iconically Romantic image of a youth, who looks up from the book on which he is leaning and gazes into the 
                    imaginative space his reading has opened up&#x2013;without concluding that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> once hoped to continue his studies at the university. 
                    Instead, his departure in <span class="date-1802">1802</span> for a mercantile life in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> compelled him to pursue self&#x2010;culture, 
                    which both his own determination and the intensifying print and visual culture of the era 
                    enabled him to support, first for himself and then for his family.
      </p>
      
      <p>Copybooks like <span class="persName-EBD">Butterworth</span>&#x02BC;s were designed to straddle the worlds of public instruction in schools and of private instruction in the home, whether by writing masters or by self&#x2010;guided practice. 
                    Even at the <span class="orgName-RHSE">Edinburgh High School</span>, the writing and arithmetic classes had always been optional, the expectation being that many youths would acquire these accomplishments 
                    on their own by various means (see <a href="../notes/butterworth_e_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-EDB">Edmund Butterworth</span> (d. 1814)</a>). 
                    In an <span class="date-1825">1825</span> advertisement, the publisher <span class="orgName-OANDB">Oliver &#x0026; Boyd</span> of <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> characterizes 
                    <span class="title-book-BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN-italic">Butterworth&#x02BC;s Young Arithmetician&#x02BC;s Instructor</span> 
                    as &#x201C;designed for the Use of Schools and Private Families,&#x201D; by &#x201C;combining accurate Writing, correct Figures, and judicious Arrangement.&#x201D; 
                    Of the five productions by <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> listed, the advertisement goes on to declare that &#x201C;&#x005B;f&#x005D;or beauty of design, and correctness of execution, 
                    these Works of Mr <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> are admired by every competent judge of Penmanship. 
                    A decided preference is accordingly given to them by the most eminent Teachers in the <span class="placeName-UK">United Kingdom</span>. 
                    They are the productions of an indefatigable genius in his profession, exercised and improved by the experience of above forty years.&#x2014;The 
                    demand for them continuing to increase, the Publishers have spared no expense in bringing them out in the superior style in which they now appear&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#OLIVERBOYDADVERTISEMENT" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Books Published by Oliver &#x0026; Boyd&#x201D;</a>, 21).
      </p>
      
      <p>As a path to self&#x2010;cultivation, copybooks typically provided instructional texts (set in letterpress) along with illustrations of writing samples in various styles or &#x201C;hands&#x201D; 
                    (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences, 
                    such as youths or ladies (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Becker, <span class="title-BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><i>Practice of Letters</i></span></a>, xi). 
                    Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <i>English round hand</i> or <i>copperplate</i>, 
                    which in the eighteenth century had settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                    An influential standard for English round hand was set by the copybook, <span class="title-book-BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN-italic">Universal Penman</span> (1733&#x2013;41), 
                    jointly authored by the engraver and writing master, <span class="persName-GBE">George Bickham</span> (1684&#x2013;1758), and his son. Practiced using a pen with a flexible quill nib, 
                    round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                    that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC" target="_blank" class="inactive">Cramsie, <span class="title-CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><i>Story of Graphic Design</i></span></a>, 119&#x2013;21). 
                    In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely 
                    the qualities which commended &#x005B;the hand&#x005D; to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received then&#x201D;; and this &#x201C;plain hand for a plain purpose&#x201D; 
                    was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span>,&#x201D; in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MORISONDEVELOPMENTOFHANDWRITING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Morison, &#x201C;Development of Hand&#x2010;Writing&#x201D;</a>, xxxiii, xl).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>While round hand developed as a business script, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early cursive hand more closely resembles the hand of his mother than that of his father, 
                    which is flamboyantly larger, more slanted, and extends long ascenders and descenders. (The contrast is vivid in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span>, <i>g</i>.1, version of

                    fair copy.) It makes sense, however, that a home&#x2010;schooled youth would imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                    from which the father was absent for protracted periods. When learning to handle pen and ink, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> declared, according to his mother, 
                    &#x201C;that the thoughts of your &#x005B;<span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s&#x005D; being pleased encourages him,&#x201D; and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> believed that &#x201C;the showing you his writing occupied his thoughts 
                    fully more than how he expressed his feelings&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 156&#x2013;57); 
                    nevertheless, it was <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> who was at hand teaching him to write. 
                    Examples of these first efforts from around <span class="date-1827-04">April 1827</span> include <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span> letter accompanying 
                    <a href="../witnesses/wales_houghton.php"><span class="title-poem-WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</span></a> 
                    (not the poem itself, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> copied in print lettering rather than cursive, albeit using a pen). An early example of cursive applied to a poem is found in 
                    <a href="../witnesses/constellations_msrft70.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;<span class="title-poem-THECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern</span>&#x201D;</a> in its RF T70 version. 
                    This version certainly predated the late 1827&#x2013;early 1828 <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> fair copy of the poem, albeit perhaps not by very long, and the hand is very awkward, but recognizably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s; 
                    and the script appears to be in ink, although the medium can no longer be proven, since the RF T70 survives only as a photograph, so far as is known. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mastery of a copperplate hand is witnessed by <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-RUSKINACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a> 
                    in his impressive <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy.
