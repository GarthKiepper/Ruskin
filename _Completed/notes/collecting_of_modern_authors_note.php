      <div class="title">The Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</div>
      
      <p>Interest in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early works 
                    belongs to a larger <span class="date-1870-1900">fin de si√®cle</span> phenomenon in book collecting whereby collectors turned
                    their attention to modern (i.e., <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span>) authors rather than
                    to incunabula and fine typography and illustration, which had preoccupied
                    collectors earlier in the century. Author societies, such as those dedicated to
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>, and <span class="persName-PBS">Percy Shelley</span>,
                    organized study of every aspect of their authors&#x02BC; lives and works; and
                    supporting this activity, industrious bibliographers, editors, publishers, and
                    booksellers produced reprints and editions of canonical modern authors&#x02BC;
                    works, including juvenilia, along with enumerative or descriptive bibliographies
                    detailing the authors&#x02BC; publications 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TASTEANDTECHNIQUE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Carter, <span class="title-book-TASTEANDTECHNIQUE-italic">Taste and Technique in Book&#x2010;Collecting</span></a>, 22).

      <div id="FIRSTEDITIONMANIA" class="section">
         <span class="head-section">Collectors&#x02BC; &#x201C;Mania&#x201D; for Modern First Editions and Juvenilia, and the Activity of Literary Forgers</span>
         
         <p>The aim was to
                        collect a run of an author&#x02BC;s publications that was complete, down to the
                        most minor and fugitive items, and that exhibited each item in its original
                        material condition. These goals led to collectors&#x02BC; competitive search for
                        rare books (causing a rise in market prices). The juvenilia and youthful writing
                        of modern authors&#x2014;what were called <i>early editions</i>&#x2014;acquired a cachet owing to their extreme scarcity. This
                        goal of comprehensiveness in collecting was controversial, as collectors appeared to place
                        exaggerated value on an author&#x02BC;s minor works. Publishers were suspected of
                        encouraging an interest in juvenilia, since the desire could be met with
                        reprints of works that were out of copyright or appeared to be neglected. Yet, despite these competitive incentives and keenness for the hunt, another
                        significant motivation for collectors&#x02BC; interest in youthful writing lay in a &#x201C;sentiment&#x201D;
                        strongly attached to these early editions in their original condition, and to juvenilia in particular. This sentiment likewise proved fraught and
                        controversial.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>In historical accounts of the <span class="date-1880-06-20-1901-01-22">late&#x2010;Victorian</span> collecting of modern authors, 
                        the less savory, competitive motivations of collectors were foregrounded, 
                        because these motivations were blamed for creating opportunities for literary forgers. In the overheated rare book market of the last decades of the century, 
                        it was all too easy to fool buyers with spurious editions of lesser known works by prolific <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> authors. Most notoriously, 
                        <span class="persName-HBF">Henry Buxton Forman</span> (<span class="date-1842-1917">1842&#x2013;1917</span>) hit upon the
                        idea&#x2014;an idea aggressively pursued by <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span>&#x02BC;s associate, 
                        <a href="../notes/wise_t_j_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-TJW">Thomas J. Wise</span> 
                            (<span class="date-1859-1937">1859&#x2013;1937</span>)</a>&#x2014;of planting descriptions of
                        heretofore &#x201C;undiscovered&#x201D; publications by modern authors in the
                        single&#x2010;author bibliographies and &#x201C;bio&#x2010;bibliographical&#x201D;
                        essays that catered to the fevered collecting interests of the period. Typically
                        described as small pamphlets, these publications never existed, but the genius
                        of the scam lay in the possibility of their existence, and in the convincingly
                        faked bibliographical descriptions that backed up their alleged histories. With this foundation laid, <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span> then
                        arranged for the pamphlets&#x02BC; forgery and their insinuation onto the market 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#COLLINSTWOFORGERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Collins, <span class="title-biography-COLLINSTWOFORGERS-italic">Two Forgers</span></a>, 43, 82). A spectacular
                        and daring example of these "creative forgeries" was <span class="persName-EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>&#x02BC;s alleged private printing 
                        in <span class="date-1847">1847</span> of the <span class="title-anthology-BROWNINGSONNETS-italic">Sonnets from the Portuguese</span> as a
                        gift for <span class="persName-RB">Robert</span>, a story that was fabricated
                        by <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman,</span> and that they followed up with forged physical copies for
                        auction.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>Modern authors&#x02BC; youthful works proved a ready target for such
                        fabrications, owing to the relative ease of inventing a tale about the origins
                        of a previously little known edition of a juvenile work that was itself obscure. As
                        it turned out, the editors of the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> of Ruskin&#x02BC;s <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE-italic">Works</span>, 
                        <a href="../notes/cook_e_t_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span></a> and 
                        <a href="../notes/wedderburn_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span></a>, 
                        were among the first to spot these spurious
                        claims. They detected the improbability of the alleged &#x201C;<span class="date-1868">1868</span>&#x201D; pamphlet of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s
                        juvenile prose tale, <a href="../apparatuses/leoni_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-prose-RUSKINLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</span></a>, as well as of the 
                        &#x201C;<span class="date-1849">1849</span>&#x201D; pamphlet of the poem, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/the_scythian_guest_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-RUSKINSCYTHIAN">&#x201C;The Scythian Guest&#x201D;</span></a>, and they commented on the suspect features of these
                        and other <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> pamphlets in the 
                        <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a>&#x02BC;s bibliographical notes on those works.
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s doubts apparently went unremarked by many collectors, for the spurious 
                        pamphlets continued to sell, but the editors&#x02BC; alarms helped prompt 
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Graham Pollard</span> and <span class="persName-JC">John Carter</span> to launch their investigation into questionable 
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> pamphlets,
                        starting with the <span class="date-1847">&#x201C;1847&#x201D;</span>

                        pamphlets in their field as early as <span class="date-1897">1897</span>, and
                        rare&#x2010;book dealers were on their guard by the <span class="date-1890-1899">late 1890s</span> against previously unknown modern
                        pamphlets suddenly emerging in the market &#x005B;ibid., pp. 88&#x2013;89&#x005D;). Meanwhile, the
                        bibliographies of several modern authors had become impaired by the
                        forgers&#x02BC; obfuscation and falsehood&#x2014;including <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, since Wise co&#x2010;opted the
                        project of the <a href="../notes/bibliography_of_ruskin_wise_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-bibliography-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYWISE-italic">Complete Bibliography of . . . Ruskin</span> (1889&#x2013;93)</a> started by 
                            <span class="persName-JPS">J. P. Smart</span> 
                        (see also <a href="../notes/forgery_and_piracy_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Forgery and Piracy</a>).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>Despite the openings for forgery enabled by the fashion for collecting modern &#x201C;firsts,&#x201D; 
                        the interest brought a number of positive scholarly developments, as well, including an
                        interest in juvenilia, and an increased and more systematic attention to
                        the bibliography of <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> books. The relish for first
                        editions&#x2014;which soon became for laymen synonymous with book
                        collecting&#x2014;was not in itself an ambition of earlier
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> collectors. Earlier collectors, insofar as they cared
                        about modern authors at all, had been drawn more to later than to first editions
                        of modern works on the presumed strength of later editions&#x02BC; sounder
                        editing or more lavish production. A boon to scholarly study of the
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> book was particularly afforded by the premium set on
                        original condition of the collectible first edition, a sound rationale that was
                        emphasized by the New Bibliographers of the <span class="date-1901-1930">early twentieth century,</span> such as
                            <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and 
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>. The career of <span class="persName-JC">Carter&#x2010;s</span> mentor, 
                        <span class="persName-MSS">Michael Sadleir</span>, started with collecting first editions of 
                        <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> writers,
                        especially novelists. As late as <span class="date-1922">1922</span> in his 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SADLEIREXCURSIONS" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-SADLEIREXCURSIONS-italic">Excursions in Victorian Bibliography</span></a>, <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span> could still quaintly characterize
                        first&#x2010;edition collecting as &#x201C;a diversion of recent growth&#x201D; pursued
                        by &#x201C;hystericals&#x201D; like himself. &#x201C;For my part to love an
                        author is to collect him,&#x201D; he explained, and the urge could be satisfied
                        only by first editions in their original condition: &#x201C;Of the absurdity of
                        this I am cheerfully aware&#x201D; (pp. 2, 3, 6). By
                        <span class="date-1945">1945,</span> in his contribution to the semicentennary anniversary volume of the
                        <span class="orgName-BIBLSOC">Bibliographical Society (London)</span>, <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span> had
                        replaced the dilettantish tone he had thought appropriate to a <span class="date-1922">1922</span> aid to
                        collectors with an emphasis on historical bibliography and methodology&#x2014;a development for which he willingly but guardedly credited 
                        the <span class="date-1871-06-20-1901-01-22">late&#x2010;Victorian</span> collector, who at least drew attention to the bibliography of modern
                        literature, but who had neglected systematic
                        study of &#x201C;the changing processes, trade customs, methods of distribution
                        and book&#x2010;buyers&#x02BC; tastes&#x201D; that made
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> books &#x201C;what they are&#x201D;

                        book collector: &#x201C;to weave&#x201D; the investigation of book&#x2010;making

                        it were a garment of biography with a texture of bibliography&#x201D;

For the
                        younger scholars, <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and 
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>, the biographical emphasis in <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span>
                        modern&#x2010;author collecting formed the impediment to bibliographical method, by
                        introducing a distracting &#x201C;sentimental element.&#x201D; 
                        In their <span class="date-1934">1934</span> 
            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ENQUIRY" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-ENQUIRY-italic">Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth&#x2010;Century Pamphlets</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> constructed a more modernist narrative to
                        explain the downfall of <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> collecting. In their view, the fashion for collecting modern firsts could never achieve scholarly method, owing to 
                        a blinding sentimentality that, combined with competitive greed,
                        led to deserved exploitation by sharpers and forgers: &#x201C;As
                        the distance in time between collectors and the object of their enthusiasm
                        lessened &#x005B;i.e., as collectors turned to moderns instead of
                        incunabula&#x005D; their interest
                        took on a more personal colour, and the sentimental element became gradually
                        stronger. Collectors were interested in the lives and habits of their favourite
                        authors; they paid more attention to minor productions; they visualised the
                        arrival of the first copies on the author&#x02BC;s breakfast table&#x2014;a
                        powerful influence in the creation of a taste for &#x2018;original

                        With this story of the rise of outmoded biographical sentiment surrounding modern
                        &#x201C;firsts,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> set the stage for their expos&#x00E9; 
                        of forgery, by accounting for the vulnerability of the <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> rare&#x2010;book market to gullibility and greed. 
                        The <span class="title-book-ENQUIRY-italic">Enquiry</span> drew on modern bibliographical
                        methodology to expose the inauthenticity of those &#x201C;certain
                        <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</span> pamphlets,&#x201D; which collectors had so ardently imagined
                        as arriving in their original wrappers on the author&#x02BC;s breakfast table. A
                        secondary implication of this narrative was that collectors had developed an
                        inordinate and ridiculous interest in modern authors&#x02BC; juvenilia, a form of publication that was particularly targeted by <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman&#x02BC; forgeries.</span>

         <p>In the <span class="title-book-ENQUIRY-italic">Enquiry</span>, following the narrative on how
                        sentimentality gained disastrous sway over the motivation of modern&#x2010;author
                        collecting, <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> summarize the debate in the 1890s over the
                        tendency of modern author collecting to favor first editions of minor works,
                        among which juvenilia are treated as self&#x2010;evidently distracting from a proper
                        aim of collecting. The conservative position was represented by

                        for the art trade, outside the institutional art history establishment, so his authority
                        depended on upholding normative standards for taste and expertise that he himself could wield

                        trend as an offense against &#x201C;rational form&#x201D; of collecting overseen by &#x201C;scholars and
                        men of judgment&#x201D; who focus on &#x201C;books of importance and books with both histories

                        their own vanity by hanging on to the coat-tails of eminent men and claim the

                        worthless tract or obsolete and ephemeral magazine article, and trumpeting it

                        upstart authority, <span class="persName-TJW">Wise,</span> writing in the <span class="title-periodical-BOOKMAN-italic">Bookman</span>, asserted a claim about modern
                        literary history, which happened to shore up the plausibility of his forged pamphlets:
                        &#x201C;Compositions which now find a fitting path to publicity through the medium of
                        the periodical press were formerly printed separately, and circulated in the
                        shape of a tract or pamphlet. A guide to such ephemera would be of the utmost
                        value to dealer and collector alike&#x201D; (quoted in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ENQUIRY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Carter and Pollard, <span class="title-book-ENQUIRY-italic">Enquiry</span></a>, 106). <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard,</span> looking back on this debate from the perspective of the <span class="title-book-ENQUIRY-italic">Enquiry</span>, in
                        which they were exposing forgery by replacing dubiously fashionable tastes in
                        collecting with bibliographic method, declared that the &#x201C;collecting public&#x201D; of
                        the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span> had in fact been &#x201C;eager, credulous and greedy&#x201D; and too &#x201C;keen on the obscurer
                        rarities of its favourite authors.&#x201D; Consequently, &#x201C;since the obscurer and more

                        to go as high as &#x00A3;42 for the &#x201C;<span class="date-1849">1849</span>&#x201D; pamphlet of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s boyhood poem,

                        the publication is a very small pamphlet published in 1905
                        at Rugby to commemorate the prize English poem for that year, won by
                        &#x201C;R.C.B.&#x201D;).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>In <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>&#x02BC;s subsequent work, he
                        attempted to establish a set of definitions and practices for sorting out bizarre &#x201C;fashions&#x201D; in collecting from good
                        &#x201C;taste&#x201D; and proper technique, and he suggested that undue attention to juvenilia
                        belongs among the former. According to his essay on <span class="title-essay-CARTERFASHIONS">&#x201C;Fashions in

                        school&#x201D; of the previous century, should be classified as mere <i>fashion</i>, defined as &#x201C;the excrescences of a
                        movement of taste, the mannerisms of an authentic style, the adoption by
                        imitators of some perhaps legitimate quiddity of a great collector&#x201C;

                        due reverence for the literary canon. Returning to the heyday of speculative <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> 
                        collecting, which he and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> had ended with publication of the <span class="title-book-ENQUIRY-italic">Enquiry</span>,
                        <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> dwelled on the mannerisms: &#x201C;The main emphasis was on the poets, and though
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s prose works were
                        collected as reverently, if not as expensively, as his verse, it was not

                        perhaps the reigning favourites&#x201D;

                        point to be taken for our purposes about such a work is that, by the <span class="date-1934-1967">mid&#x2010;twentieth
                            century,</span> it had become non&#x2010;controversial to treat the <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> collector, in <span class="persName-MSS">Sadleir</span>&#x02BC;s words, with a
                        &#x201C;suspicion&#x201D; that had become
                        &#x201C;deeply engrained in the mind of scholars and librarians&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#DEVELOPMENTBIBLIOGRAPHICALSTUDY" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-essay-DEVELOPMENTBIBLIOGRAPHICALSTUDY">&#x201C;Development of Bibliographical Study,&#x201D;</span></a> 147). The
                        problem with such suspicions, and with making such vague concepts as
                        &#x201C;sentimentality&#x201D; operative in a historical narrative about collecting in the
                            <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s,</span> is that <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>&#x02BC;s normative &#x201C;taste&#x201D; and &#x201C;technique&#x201D; overwrite the debate
                        in which <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> collectors themselves engaged over the nature and role of 
                        <i>sentiment</i> for the physical book. In the 
                        <span class="date-1870-1899">1870s through the 1890s</span>, writers on
                        collecting characterized a &#x201C;sentiment for the book&#x201D; as a new phenomenon, and
                        the collecting community debated the nature and value of this sentiment along with
                        the goals it sponsored&#x2014;such as the value of acquiring each and every
                        publication by a popular modern author, including &#x201C;minor&#x201D;
                        productions from juvenilia to last words, in order to form a comprehensive
                        collection of that writer (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hanson, <span class="title-essay-SENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">&#x201C;Sentiment and Materiality in Late&#x2010;Victorian Book Collecting&#x201D;</span></a>).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>For example, a popular writer of the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span> on book collecting and a promoter of
                        collecting &#x201C;early editions,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JHS">J. H. Slater</span> 
                        (<span class="date-1854">1854</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1921">1921</span>), used the term <i>sentiment</i> as roughly
                        synonymous with <i>bibliophily</i> to describe an appreciation
                        for the physical book as distinct, on the one hand, from utilitarian uses of
                        books, and, on the other, from fashionable or eccentric forms of collecting that
                        resulted in mutilation of books (i.e., such practices as
                        extra&#x2010;illustration or cutting out title pages or colophons to form a
                        collection). Thus, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> anticipated <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span>&#x02BC;s distinction between <i>fashion</i> 
                        in collecting and proper <i>taste</i> and <i>technique</i>, 
                        but he did not automatically consign <i>sentiment</i> to a cause of mere fashion. 
                        For <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>, sentiment for the book was historically recent, and a phenomenon in need of analysis:
                        &#x201C;Of a truth books have only recently come to be regarded as possessing a
                        sentimental value altogether distinct from considerations of utility&#x201D;
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Slater, <span class="title-book-SLATERROMANCE-italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</span></a>, 95).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>The new sentiment was perceived as forming especially around preservation of modern first editions in their original condition. In
                        <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1894">1894</span>

                        speculates why the sentiment for modern authors&#x02BC; early works depended on
                        maintaining the physical copy in its original condition. Such copies, he writes, were likely to have been neglected or destroyed before the
                        author&#x02BC;s fame could bestow special interest on the publications; and
                        thus, when &#x201C;these first&#x2010;fruits, crude though they generally
                        are,&#x201D; come to light along with the rising fame of their author, they gain
                        an appropriate sentimental value, which is only further compounded by their
                        scarcity: &#x201C;the fact that many people want the few copies that have
                        escaped the wrack of neglect, makes them objects of unusual interest. The
                        inevitable reprint comes at last, but it is not the same; sentiment still hangs
                        around the shabby volume of years ago, with all its errors&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#EARLYEDITIONS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Slater, <span class="title-book-EARLYEDITIONS-italic">Early Editions</span></a>, vii).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>To account for the formation of this sentiment, 
                        <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> pointed to a number of possible origins. The
                        collecting of modern book illustration, which started earlier in the century,
                        instigated a search for early editions for the sake of sharper,
                        early&#x2010;state impressions of engravings and woodcuts. Another cause of
                        collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for original condition was the interest in tracing textual revisions by favorite modern
                        authors through successive editions&#x2014;a scholarly attraction prompted by a tendency of some 
                        modern writers, such as <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, to publish successive, revised versions of their work 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#EARLYEDITIONS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Slater, <span class="title-book-EARLYEDITIONS-italic">Early Editions</span></a>, v&#x2013;vii; 
                        see also <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Slater, <span class="title-book-SLATERROMANCE-italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</span></a>, 118&#x2013;19). In describing the
                        latter motivation, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> does reflect a sentimentality in <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and
                        <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>&#x02BC;s sense of the collector&#x02BC;s imaginary closeness to the life
                        of a favorite author. Dramatizing the appeal of the first edition, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> evokes a
                        &#x201C;personal connection&#x201D; with the author: &#x201C;It may be assumed
                        that the author has in the vast majority of cases seen and handled the book for
                        which he was himself responsible; the very copy we hold in our hand may have
                        belonged to him.&#x201D; Despite such over&#x2010;dramatization, <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span>&#x02BC;s
                        idea of a sentiment driving a nascient textual criticism of modern literature is
                        legitimately scholarly, and not merely nostalgic: first
                        editions, he argues, supply the possibility of tracing &#x201C;the working of the
                        author&#x02BC;s mind by a comparison of the wording of one edition with that of
                        another,&#x201D; and of understanding &#x201C;why &#x005B;the author&#x005D; made the
                        alterations&#x201D; and even &#x201C;enter&#x005B;ing&#x005D; into &#x005B;the
                        author&#x02BC;s&#x005D; thoughts, and perhaps . . . appreciat&#x005B;ing&#x005D; his feelings&#x201D; about such revisions
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SLATERHOWTOCOLLECT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Slater, <span class="title-book-SLATERHOWTOCOLLECT-italic">How to Collect Books</span></a> 182).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>This sentiment for early editions, along with the perception of the sentiment as
                        a phenomenon of recent date, was not in itself controversial, although <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> present the movement two&#x2010;dimensionally, 
                        with opponents and supporters ranged on either side of a monolithic issue, as the besotted public went on purchasing heedlessly. 
                        In fact, <span class="persName-WR">William Roberts</span>, while 
                        continuing to berate the &#x201C;cult&#x201D; surrounding firsts, confessed to sharing an
                        appreciation of the &#x201C;charm &#x005B;that&#x005D; is so much a matter of feeling&#x201D; in the
                        &#x201C;attraction of a first edition&#x201D; (or so he conceded, at least, 
                        in the moderated language with which he toned down his <span class="title-periodical-FORTNIGHTLYREVIEW-italic">Fortnightly</span> essays when collected in book form). 
                        He goes on: Even if one puts aside the features of a preserved 
                        first edition that, to a bibliographer, are &#x201C;much more than sentimental&#x201D; (e.g.,
                        the survival for posterity of papers, typefaces, and bindings that have fallen
                        out of fashion), the appeal of an early edition &#x201C;falls into the category of
                        things which are not explainable&#x201D; to &#x201C;the utilitarian.&#x201D; The shabby volume is
                        &#x201C;esteemed as bringing our sons or grandsons nearer than any amount of written
                        description to our own &#x2018;old&#x2014; times.&#x201D; The pleasure is &#x201C;spiritual&#x201D; and the
                        &#x201C;experience . . . a thing of feeling and not of argument&#x201D;

                        comprehensive collecting was expressed on the <span class="placeName-USA">American</span> side, like the English, 
                        with <span class="persName-FWH">Francis Whiting Halsey</span>, a journalist prominent in book reviewing for the New York newspapers, writing in <span class="date-1902">1902</span> with some alarm over the

                        including the &#x201C;large volume of reprints&#x201D; and modern editions.
                        While <span class="persName-FWH">Halsey</span> regarded reprint editors as public servants owing to their sympathy with
                        their subjects, and he comments favorably on the high demand for modern
                        firsts in <span class="persName-USA">America</span> as in 
                        <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, he is dubious about the state of the market for such collecting: 
                        &#x201C;In <span class="placeName-USA">this country</span> it is early, choice, or curious editions of
                        standard modern authors that fetch large sums,&#x201D; in spite of &#x201C;sharp
                            <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">English</span> competition&#x201D;

         </p>
         
         <p>In this lively competition among collectors to make their modern author
                        collections comprehensive, the controversy arose in part, as <span class="persName-FWH">Halsey</span> suggests, from a perceived
                        distortion of pricing in the market for rarities. For <span class="persName-WR">William Roberts,</span> excessive value
                        was placed on copies of minor publications as compared with canonical works:
                        &#x201C;Where a collector desires to have a complete series of the works written by the
                        author or authors to whom he devotes his attention,&#x201D; <span class="persName-WR">Roberts</span> remarked, a handful of
                        first editions took on a disproportionate value merely because &#x201C;they are
                        exceedingly rare, and . . . that is about as much as can be urged in their
                        favour.&#x201D; In the case of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin,</span> for example, the value of first editions of the
                        major works had declined in the market, while &#x201C;the publications of Mr. Ruskin
                        which more than maintain their commercial value are those which are quite
                        unknown except to the specialist. They are little pamphlets and tracts, which
                        were, for the most part, printed in exceedingly small numbers, and are now
                        practically unprocurable. Although there are about a dozen collectors who have
                        spared neither time nor money to render their Ruskiniana complete, we believe
                        that not more than one can claim to have an absolutely final series of the works
                        of the &#x2018;master.&#x2019; A rough calculation places the value of a complete set of
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> at not much short of &#x00A3;300 for about sixty distinct publications&#x201D;

                        collections at the fin de si√®cle, certain modern juvenilia are repeatedly singled out as holding a

                        the circumstances attending its production, the personality of the writer, and
                        its excessive rarity&#x201D;

         <p>Whereas the comprehensive single&#x2013;author collection that highlighted such items
                        caused conservatives like <span class="persName-WR">William Roberts</span> to lament the deteriorating appreciation of
                        the canon&#x2014;and, more immediately, the derangement of prices in the rare book
                        market&#x2014;it was a perhaps even more disconcerting development of the new collecting that its biographical justification led some proponents to put
                        traditional valuation out of the picture altogether. In an

                        bibliographer&#x201D; as distinct from a &#x201C;collector,&#x201D; and in that capacity he pronounced
                        &#x201C;the prices at which scarce books in favour with collectors have found a

                        the consequent tendency he perceived among writers on collecting like 
                        <span class="persName-JHS">Slater</span> to rank the importance of modern first

                        From his standpoint as a &#x201C;complete bibliographer,&#x201D;
                        &#x201C;the bibliographical importance of one book by any particular author is
                        as great as the bibliographical importance of any other book by the same writer.

                            <span class="persName-WFP">Prideaux</span> was perhaps correct to set apart

                        as many amounted to mere enumerative handlists compared to <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-JPS">Smart</span>&#x02BC;s elaborate descriptive bibliography. Yet even the handlists of publications by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and of other writers that

                        and he carried his <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> bibliography through five editions in pursuit of that goal. 
                        In this pursuit, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> anticipated <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-JPS">Smart</span> in identifying <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earliest publications.

         <p>This publishing industry in support of the comprehensive collecting of modern firsts&#x2014;a curiosity in terms of what modern literary figures it highlighted, 
                        as well as of what nineteenth&#x2010;century authors it overlooked&#x2014;was an irritant to detractors of the movement. 
                        It enraged <span class="persName-WR">William Roberts</span> that, in the collectors&#x02BC; market, &#x201C;every little volume of drivelling verse&#x201D; and other &#x201C;ephemera&#x201D; could be 
                        &#x201C;heralded as a wonderful and valuable piece of literature&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FIRSTEDITIONMANIA" target="_blank" class="inactive">Roberts, <span class="title-essay-FIRSTEDITIONMANIA">&#x201C;The First Edition Mania&#x201D;</span></a>, 347, 349). 
                        To the editors of the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span>, it was a matter of &#x201C;astonishment and regret that publishers can be found for such undertakings&#x201D; as reprints and &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volumes&#x2014;the 
                        kinds of labors for which <a href="../notes/shepherd_r_h_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span></a> was known 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <span class="title-anthology-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878-italic">The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span></a>, 766). 
            <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was perhaps the most prolific compiler of single&#x2010;author bibliographies, and he
                        was inventive and industrious in developing other kinds of publications serving the new
                        collecting interests, such as reprints of neglected works by modern authors, and
                        &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volumes constructing a biographical narrative using selected earlier
                        versions of texts that authors subsequently revised (e.g., <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TENNYSONIANA" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-book--italic">Tennysoniana</span></a>). 
                        These kinds of publications made <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> a target 
                        in another controversy that formed around the aim of comprehensiveness in modern author
                        collecting&#x2014;namely, the resistance by authors themselves to seeing their early works or other ephemeral texts, or
                        earlier versions of their more canonical texts, revived in the form of edited reprints or aids to study like the &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volume. 
                        Hostile authors and their representatives, such as reviewers for the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span>, reviled <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> and his ilk 
                        as <i>vampires</i> and as <i>resurrection men</i>, meaning <i>body snatchers</i>. 
                        <span class="persName-AT">Tennyson</span> was
                        particularly hostile to the reprint industry, which he regarded as mere piracy, and he led the way in taking legal action against <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                        and other editors and publishers engaged in such activity.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>At the core of these court cases was a question of authors&#x02BC; control over their <i>oeuvre</i> and 
                        states of their texts. <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> took up battle against such publications as early as <span class="date-1862">1862</span>, 
                        when <span class="persName-JDC">James Dykes Campbell</span> 
                        printed a piracy of <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>&#x02BC;s early poems 
                        &#x201C;without the compiler&#x02BC;s name, place of publication, without even the <span class="persName-ALT">author</span>&#x02BC;s name, simply titled 
                        <span class="title-anthology-TENNYSONPOEMS-italic">Poems. MDCCCXXX. MDCCCXXXIII</span>.&#x201D; The alleged purpose of the volume was to aid readers who wished to study the <span class="persName-ALT">Laureate</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        revised and suppressed states of poems, but <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> defied the legitimacy and legality of such an undertaking

                        Later, in <span class="date-1875-1876">1875&#x2010;76,</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span> incurred 
                        <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>&#x02BC;s wrath over a pirated printing of the poet&#x02BC;s early work, <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVER">&#x201C;A Lover&#x02BC;s Tale&#x201D;</span>

                        Having pleaded guilty to that piracy, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> soon again, in <span class="date-1876">1876,</span>, found
                        himself at odds with a prominent author, when the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Atheneaum</span> 
                        took the part of <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span> in opposing a reprint that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> proposed to edit,

                        When <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> placed a notice in the press of this forthcoming reprint, 
                        <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> asked the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span> to denounce the project, arguing that its most substantial text,

                        <span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND-italic">Prometheus Bound</span>, would violate the late poet&#x02BC;s wishes, as she had effectively suppressed this text by publishing a new translation of the play in

                        so far as to exclude the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> version of <span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND-italic">Prometheus Bound</span>, but he 
                        retained <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span>&#x02BC;s shorter poems that filled out the original <span class="date-1833">1833</span> volume. 
                        Because <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span>&#x02BC;s juvenile publications were out of copyright, 
                        and copies readily available to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s inspection 
                        in the <span class="orgName-BRITISHLIBRARY">British Library</span> for transcription and editing, 
                        the legality of the reprint had to be admitted by the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span>. The journal&#x02BC;s editors nonetheless expressed indignation that 
                        the author&#x02BC;s spouse did not necessarily maintain control over the public domain of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        youthful publications, and the journal proceeded to attack <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> on ethical grounds: 
                        &#x201C;Were it a question of tables or chairs, <span class="persName-RB">Mr. Browning</span> could defend the wishes of his

                        remedy, and <span class="persName-RB">Mr. Shepherd</span> is quite at liberty to defy the wishes of the dead, and to outrage the feelings of the living&#x201D;

         <p><span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> replied to this charge by boldly asserting the scholar&#x02BC;s right to materials for study, and 
                        denying that &#x201C;a poet himself, or the relations of a poet, may . . . always be the best or the final judges of what should continue to hold a place 
                        in the collection of his writings&#x201D;; and that far from intending an outrage of the author&#x02BC;s feelings, the &#x201C;poetical student&#x201D; 
                        owned a rightful claim to studying the author&#x02BC;s development, starting with the earliest flowering of literary genius&#x2014;the &#x201C;nameless and 
                        peculiar charm&#x201D; to be found in the &#x201C;early spring&#x201D; of an author&#x02BC;s juvenilia

                        This declaration by <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> of the significance of juvenilia in a writer's development, 
                        and of the &#x201C;poetical student&#x02BC;s&#x201D; right of access to such material, was met with more than derision by

                        the writer, <span class="persName-TWD">Theodore Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span>, attacked not only the morality and professionalism of the reprint&#x02BC;s editor and publisher, 
                        but also the credibility and even the national interest of this view of poetics and the study of an author&#x02BC;s development. 
                        &#x201C;Early printing&#x201D; by authors of promise must be discouraged, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> demanded; 
                        and insofar as the publication of juvenilia proves &#x201C;necessary to the full development of a country&#x02BC;s literary potentialities,&#x201D; 
                        such publication should be regulated, like the young author himself or herself, in order to &#x201C;discharge&#x201D; as much &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D; 
                        as possible to the benefit the nation&#x02BC;s literary history

                        According to <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span>, the health of the nation&#x02BC;s literary culture depended on the suppression of modern authors&#x02BC; juvenilia.

         <span class="head-section">The Response by the <span class="orgName-BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</span> to Collecting of Modern Authors and Juvenilia</span>
         
         <p>In <span class="date-1879-06">June 1879</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span> pressed a libel suit against the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span> 
                        for accusing him of dishonesty and vampirism, among other slanders. <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> won his case, securing &#x00A3;150 in damages, 
                        not long after <span class="persName-JAMW">James McNeill Whistler</span> achieved a merely Pyrrhic victory of a farthing&#x02BC;s worth of damages 
                        in his <span class="date-1878-11">November 1878</span> libel trial against <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Both libel suits were concerned at a fundamental level 
                        with questions of artistic or literary value and the authority for determining such value and holding public sway over such determinations. The issues never arose between 
                        between <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> or the 
                        <span class="orgName-BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</span>, because <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> never attempted to reprint works by 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, and so a more straightforward violation of intellectual property never brought forward the grander issues of artistic value 
                        and authority. (The true property thief, <span class="persName-TJW">T. J. Wise</span>, meanwhile went undetected. In <span class="date-1934">1934</span>, 
                        when he was finally accused of forgery, Wise tried to pin the crime on <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>; and both he and <span class="persName-HBF">Forman</span> 
                        had evidently tried to confuse the trail by forging <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s piracies! See

                        Had <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s research for the

                        the editor to attempted piracies of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youthful work, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> might have been more 
                        sympathetic than were either <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> or <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span> to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s belief in the &#x201C;nameless and

                        pre&#x2010;empted any attempted piracy by printing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early work themselves.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>When <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> began sending installments of his bibliography to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                        the latter responded appreciatively to its &#x201C;perfect reckoning up of me,&#x201D; although he added: &#x201C;I will not say that you have wasted your time; 
                        but I may at least regret the quantity of trouble.&#x201D; Despite this diffidence, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was 
                        &#x201C;especially glad to have note of the letters to newspapers,&#x201D; which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> had unearthed 
                        (letters reprinted in <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINARROWS-italic">Arrows of the Chase</span> &#x005B;1880&#x005D;, in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE-italic">Works</span></a> 34:537). 
                        Whether or not <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was aware of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s reputation for piracy 
                        (the exchange predated <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s successful libel suit, if that would made any difference), 
                        the author soon moved to appoint his former <span class="orgName-OXFORDU">Oxford</span> student, <a href="../notes/wedderburn_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> (d. <span class="date-1931">1931</span>)</a>, 
                        to edit a reprint of these fugitive newspaper pieces. The resulting miscellanies 
                        came to be entitled <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINARROWS-italic">Arrows of the Chase</span> (1880) and <span class="title-anthology--italic">On the Old Road</span> (1885).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>Both of these anthologies plumb <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youth in some fashion. <span class="title-anthology--italic">On the Old Road</span> 
                        opens with <span class="title-poem-RUSKINFIRSTEDITOR">&#x201C;My First Editor,&#x201D;</span> an &#x201C;autobiographical reminiscence&#x201D; of

                        whose relation with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started with the boyhood poetry 
                        (and whose talents for exacting editorial labor resembled <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s, albeit without sharing the latter&#x02BC;s dubious ethics).  
                        <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINARROWS-italic">Arrows of the Chase</span>, as an anthology of the public letters to newspapers, could extend no further back than what 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had first sent to the papers in <span class="date-1843">1843</span>. Nonetheless, <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> 
                        forced the collection backward into the juvenilia, as it were, by means of an appended volume, <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINIANA-italic">Ruskiniana</span> (1890), 
                        which opened with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Ωs boyhood letters to the writers

                        Add to these publications the <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891-italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>)</a>,

                        and it appears that, far from objecting to the new collecting trend, or to the publishing industry supporting its enthusiasts, 
                        the <span class="orgName-BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</span> stepped forward to supply such publications on their own.

                        <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, presenting sample entries focused specifically on juvenilia:

                        as "an extremely perfect type of the . . . temper of my mind, at the beginning of days just as much as at their end"

                        In expressing thanks to <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> and <span class="persName-JPS">Smart</span> for their prospectus, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was therefore disingenuous&#x2014;although he notably felt compelled to say, as he had similarly remarked to Shepherd&#x2014;that 
                        they had taken too much &#x201C;trouble over a lot of worthless stuff!&#x201D; 
                        (quoted in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WISERUSKINI" target="_blank" class="inactive">Dearden, <span class="title-essay-WISERUSKINI">&#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I&#x201D;</span></a>, 48). 
                        The emphasis of the prospectus was in keeping with collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for modern firsts in original condition, and with readers&#x02BC; interest 
                        in the textual origins of modern writing. The prospectus was also in keeping with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s autobiographical writing, 
                        and with the <span class="orgName-BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</span>&#x02BC;s anthologizing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenilia.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>At the same time, if the <span class="orgName-BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</span> did not share in <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> and <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span>&#x02BC;s hostilities 
                        to collectors, the relation could be fraught and distant. In the <span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891-italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> acknowledged his debt 
                        to <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span>, having &#x201C;gladly availed&#x201D; himself of the &#x201C;full account of the published poems given&#x201D; in the

                        and <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> remained friendly with <span class="persName-JSAR">Joan Severn</span>. 
                        He apparently never succeeded in gaining an entr&#x00E9;e to <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, however, 
                        and he obtained little purchase on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscript treasures

         </p>
         
         <p>A shadow seems to be cast, too, over <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s editorial role by 
                        the alarm raised by <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> and the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span> over the activities of 
                        literary &#x201C;resurrection men.&#x201D; In the introduction to <span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891-italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>), 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> is anxious to anticipate and exonerate himself from the charge that a finely produced edition of 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenilia could have been actuated only by an editor&#x02BC;s greed, 
                        or that republication of &#x201C;minor&#x201D; work must have violated the rights and wishes of the author&#x2014;the 
                        baseness that the <span class="title-periodical-ATHENAEUM-italic">Athenaeum</span> attributed to reprint &#x201C;hacks&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <span class="title-anthology-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878-italic">The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span></a>, 765). 
            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> relays the biographical justification for the study of juvenilia: 
                        &#x201C;There is always a peculiar interest in watching development, in witnessing growth,&#x201D; he argues, 
                        echoing <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s metaphor for the child genius as nature, 
                        &#x201C;the bursting into bud and leaf of a new poetic genius&#x201D; 
                        (as compared with Wordsworth&#x02BC;s idea of the child&#x02BC;s genius developing <i>in</i> nature) 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891-italic">Poems</span> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:xix;

                        But <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> also jealously links his &#x201C;sympathy&#x201D; for child genius to &#x201C;ownership&#x201D;; 
                        he erects a barrier against <span class="persName-RHD">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s suggestion that &#x201C;poetical students&#x201D; 
                        may be better judges of what should be preserved from authors&#x02BC; childhood writing than the authors themselves or their families, 
                        and that once &#x201C;poems have been fully given to the world,&#x201D; they become &#x201C;the world&#x02BC;s possessions,&#x201D; the wards of 
                        &#x201C;poetical students &#x005B;who&#x005D; will not allow them to die, however indifferent the general public may be to them&#x201D;

            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> keeps the collector at bay: &#x201C;When we have seen a plant burst the soil, . . . it is our own,&#x201D; 
                        he emphasizes. &#x201C;As we follow . . . &#x005B;the&#x005D; first steps &#x005B;of great men&#x005D; . . . they become our own by sympathy.&#x201D; 
                        The plural third&#x2010;person pronoun allows some comaraderie with collectors without necessarily sharing possession: 
                        &#x201C;It is no idle curiosity, then, that prompts the admirers of <span class="persName-JR">Mr. Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s works 
                        to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891-italic">Poems</span> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:xix;

         </p>
         
         <p>This coolness did not deter collectors from seeking <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> rarities. Despite <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> 
                        and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> being the first to raise suspicions about the pamphlet reprints of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> juvenilia, 
                        thereby helping to set <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> on the path to their <span class="date-1934">1934</span> expos&#x00E9;, 
                        these doubts did not prevent the &#x201C;<span class="date-1868">1868</span>&#x201D; <a href="../apparatuses/leoni_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-prose-RUSKINLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        from outselling other <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> forgeries by four to one in auctions between the late 
                        <span class="date-1887-1920">1880s and 1920</span>, or retard the bidding on the &#x201C;<span class="date-1849">1849</span>&#x201D;

                        <span class="title-prose-RUSKINLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni,&#x201D;</span> but that fetched breathtaking prices when it did appear 
                        (see <a href="../apparatuses/leoni_apparatus.php#COMPPUB" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-prose-RUSKINLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</span>: Composition and Publication</a>; and

         </p>
         
         <p>Through the <span class="date-1930-1934">early 1930s</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collecting still showed signs of what 
                        <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> would soon categorize as the bizarre &#x201C;fashion&#x201D; of such minor fare as juvenilia 
                        distorting the market. Surprisingly high auction prices were by commanded by early <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> manuscripts 
                        as compared to prices for manuscripts of works written in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s maturity. 
                        At the <a href="../notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sotheby&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1930</a> 
                        and the <a href="../notes/provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sotheby&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1931</a>,
                        manuscripts associated with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youth sold for prices competitive with those for manuscripts of such canonical works 
                        as <span class="title-novel-STONESOFVENICE-italic">The Stones of Venice</span>; and prices given for early manuscripts were often were significantly greater than those given for manuscripts of late works. 
                        It is possibly a sign of the ongoing &#x201C;mania&#x201D; for &#x201C;firsts&#x201D; and &#x201C;early editions,&#x201D; 
                        that these early manuscripts were sold alongside modern <span class="date-1801-1900">(i.e., nineteenth&#x2010;century)</span> first editions: 
                        the <span class="date-1930">1930</span> sale included presentation copies by modern authors from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s library, 
                        along with a prominent lot of books, drawings, and letters by the children&#x02BC;s author and illustrator, <span class="persName-CKG">Kate Greenaway</span> 
                        (the latter underscoring associations with childhood, as well); 
                        and the <span class="date-1931">1931</span> sale included a &#x201C;small library . . . of modern authors&#x201D; 
                        unrelated to the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> collection, as well as more modern firsts by from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s library, 
                        including correspondence by modern authors to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Perhaps the association of these lots indicates that, 
                        as late as <span class="date-1930-1931">1930&#x2013;31</span>, the collecting of modern&#x2010;author firsts helped to buoy 
                        the prices for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s manuscript juvenilia, just as <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span> 
                        remarked with dismay the princely sum given as recently as <span class="date-1931">1931</span> for a juvenile 
                        publication by Rupert Brooke. If these associations still held held force, <span class="placeName-SOTHEBYS">Sotheby&#x02BC;s</span> 
                        auctioned the early Ruskin manuscripts in the nick of time, for after <span class="date-1934">1934</span> 
                        vestiges of the late&#x2010;Victorian collecting phenomenon would succumb to <span class="persName-JC">Carter</span> and <span class="persName-HGP">Pollard</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        expos&#x00E9; of forgery and their modernist contempt for <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian</span> sentimentality.
