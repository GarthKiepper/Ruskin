      <div class="title">Tours of 1822&#x2013;24</div>
      
      <p>Prior to <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, the Ruskins would have traveled little for pleasure. In <span class="date-1822-01">January 1822</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>
                    wrote with pleasure to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> about their journey together as a newly married couple in <span class="date-1818">1818</span>, 
                    coming from <span class="placeName-LEICESTER">Leicester</span> to <span class="placeName-STAMFORD">Stamford</span>, where they stayed at the ancient <span class="placeName-">George Inn</span>.
                    In reply, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> referred briefly to a holiday in the <span class="persName-KENT">Kent</span> seaside town of <span class="placeName-SANDGATE">Sandgate</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 104, 105n, 107; 
                    and see <a href="../notes/seaside_resorts_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-SEASIDE">Seaside Resorts</span></a> for the Ruskins&#x02BC; attraction to these places).
      </p>
      
      <p>The earliest family tours to be reflected directly in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s juvenilia
                    are discussed in <a href="../notes/tours_of_1826-27_note.php" target="_blank">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</a>; the present note
                    concerns tours known mainly by family tradition.
      </p>
      
      <p>In a <span class="date-1822-02-23-1822-02-24">23&#x2013;24 February 1822</span> letter to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>
                    eloquently describes the charms of the &#x201C;beautiful Ride . . . , differing from if not excelling all other Rides,&#x201D; between
                    <span class="placeName-WARWICK">Warwick</span> and <span class="placeName-COVENTRY">Coventry</span> and including <span class="placeName-KENILWORTH">Kenilworth</span>, which he
                    hopes &#x201C;to view . . . with my Love some summers day&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 118). 
                    That the family did undertake a tour in <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, perhaps sometime between 
                    <span class="date-1822-05-1822-09">May and September</span>, is supported by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s
                    remark to <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout (<span class="date-1783-1852">1783&#x2013;1852</span>)</span></a>, 
                    albeit made over two decades later in a letter of <span class="date-1844-04-29">29 April 1844</span>, 
                    that he had been &#x2018;born <i>again</i>, <span class="date-1822-02-08-1823-02-07">at three years old</span>,&#x2019; among the
                    <span class="geogName-CUMBERLANDHLS">Cumberland Hills</span> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 38:339)&#x2014;the remark thus 
                    adding a religious association to experiences that his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1822">1822</span> letter had characterized 
                    solely in terms of the picturesque.
      </p>
      
      <p>If a tour comprising the <span class="geogName-MIDLANDS">Midlands</span> and <span class="placeName-CUMBERLAND">Cumberland</span> was ambitious enough for a family with a three&#x2010;year&#x2010;old, 
                    the itinerary may have extended to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, 
                    as <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> points out. According to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writing decades later in <span class="title-PRAETERITA">Praeterita</span>, 
                    this leg of the journey was reached by water:
                    &#x201C;I had gone to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in <span class="persName-CS">Captain Spinks</span>&#x02BC;s cutter, then a regular passage boat, when I was only
                    <span class="date-1822-02-08-1823-02-07">three years old</span>&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:105; 
                    see also <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 11920 n. 1).
      </p>
      
      <p>It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was referring to a steam cutter, steam travel for passengers and tourism having been available in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> since <span class="date-1812">1812</span>, 
                    when the first commercial steamboat in Europe, the <i>Comet</i>, began operating on the <span class="geogName-CLYDERIVER">Clyde River</span>. Of the 141 steam vessels 
                    built in Britain by <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, 23 operated off the east coast of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TOURISMANDIDENTITY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Grenier, <i>Tourism and Identity in Scotland</i></a>, 60; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BAINPERTHSTEAM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bain, &#x201C;Perth Steam Packet Company&#x201D;</a>, 411). Whether the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey was by steam or sail, 
                    a journey to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> by water was not unlikely, 
                    since trade conditions during the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic War</span> encouraged the development of company&#x2010;owned &#x201C;lines&#x201D; of coastal vessels 
                    in competition with independent vessels&#x2014;one such company being especially germane to the Ruskins&#x02BC; northern destination, 
                    the <span class="orgName-DP&#x0026;L">Dundee, Perth &#x0026; London Shipping Company</span>, which carried passengers as well as cargo. 
                    Scholarship on this line includes mention of a <span class="persName-SPINKS">Captain Spinks</span> who, like many of the experienced captains chosen to effect the company&#x02BC;s transition from sail to steam, 
                    had difficulties maneuvering the comparatively unmanageable steam &#x201C;smacks&#x201D; (i.e., coastal cutters), and this <span class="persName-SPINKS">Spinks</span> 
                    was formally admonished for repeatedly incurring damage to his steam smack, the <i>Perth</i> throughout <span class="date-1836-1837">1836&#x2013;37</span>
                    from collisions that included running over an oyster fishing smack 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JACKSONTRANSFERTOSTEAM" target="_blank" class="inactive">Jackson, &#x201C;Operational Problems of the Transfer to Steam&#x201D;</a>, 154&#x2013;55, 165).
      </p>
      
      <p>There is in addition a tradition that the family visited the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> in <span class="date-1824">1824</span> . 
                    This journey may be associated with one to <a href="../notes/perth_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span></a> since 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s uncle, <a href="../notes/richardson_patrick_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-PR">Patrick Richardson</span></a>,
                    died on <span class="date-1824-07-20">July 20 of that year</span>, although a family tour may have been underway or even completed by that time of the <span class="date-1824-06-21-1824-09-22">summer</span>.
