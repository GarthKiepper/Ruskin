      <span class="head"><span class="persName-">Charles Thomas Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1811-1834">1811&#x2013;34</span>)</span>
      
      <p>Cousin of <span class="persName-">John Ruskin</span>, a son of <span class="persName-">Margaret</span> <span class="persName-">Ruskin's sister, Bridget</span>, and her husband <span class="persName-">George Richardson</span>, a baker. 
                    The Richardsons lived in the suburb of , near the <span class="placeName-">King's Head</span>, the tavern operated by Margaret and <span class="persName-">Bridget</span>'s mother, <span class="persName-"> Margaret Cock</span>, and the sisters' birthplace. 
                    <span class="persName-">Margaret</span> took <span class="persName-">John</span> from a very young age to visit his <span class="placeName-">Croydon</span> cousins, though he was distanced from the family, being kept on walks or in his room, 
                    except for visits by <span class="persName-">Charles</span> and his sister <span class="persName-">Mary</span> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i>, 108).</a></p>
      
      <p>By <span class="date-1829-10"> October 1829</span>, <span class="persName-">Charles</span> was employed by the publisher,<span class="orgName-"> Smith, Elder, </span> for at this time he presented <span class="persName-">John</span> with a copy of 
                    <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.html" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 
                    the "Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer" that the firm had recently taken over from its initial publisher. The editor was 
                    <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note.html" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-">Thomas Pringle </span>(<span class="date-1789-1834">1789&#x2013;1834</span>)</a>, who was possibly introduced to the Ruskin family through the <span class="orgName-">Smith, Elder</span> connection. 
                    According to <i>Praeterita</i>, <span class="persName-">Charles</span> decided to emigrate to <span class="placeName-">Australia</span> to join his brother, ???, 
                    because advancement at the publishing firm was unlikely. <span class="persName-">Charles</span> was drowned while the ship remained anchored off <span class="placeName-">Cowes</span> in <span class="date-1834-01">January 1834</span> 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35: 135-37). 
                    One wonders whether <span class="persName-">Pringle</span>--whose experience had been mixed as an immigrant to <span class="placeName-">South Africa</span>, and who coincidentally died later in the same year--had encouraged the move.
