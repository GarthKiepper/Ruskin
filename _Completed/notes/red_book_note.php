      <p>The term by which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his parents referred to store&#x2010;bought stationer&#x02BC;s notebooks with reddish&#x2010;brown,
                    flexible leather covers (described specifically as <i>roan</i> in Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <span class="title-catalog_auction-SOTHEBYCAT1930-italic">Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin</span> &#x005B;1930&#x005D;, 20&#x2013;21), 
                    each approximately 15 centimeters tall by 10 centimeters wide. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span> exchange the term in referring, for example, 
                    to <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> (letter of <span class="date-1829-03-10">10 March 1829</span>, in 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-RFL-italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></a>, 192), and presumably extended the term 
                    to all the (presently known and extant) notebooks resembling it: that is,
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiiia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIIIA">MS IIIA</span></a>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a>,
                    <a href="../apparatuses/juvenilia_a.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-JUVMSA">Juvenilia MS A</span></a>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/juvenilia_b.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-JUVMSB">Juvenilia MS B</span></a>, and

      </p>
      
      <p>Judging by references to the Red Books in family letters, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed in these notebooks mainly at home, although their contents 
                    suggest that he may occasionally have carried some of them on family travels through <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, 
                    and <span class="placeName-NBRITAIN">North Britain</span>. Certainly, he used the Red Books to reflect on travel, as in his small anthologies of topographical verse, 
                    such as <a href="../notes/poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;Poetry Discriptive&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/juvenilia_c.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-JUVMSC">Juvenilia MS C</span></a> served the family as his imitation of a travel guidebook, 
                    containing the <a href="../apparatuses/travel_itinerary_and_tour_notes_1828.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-essay-JRTRAVELITINERARY1828">Travel Itinerary and Tour Notes &#x005B;1828&#x005D;</span></a> 
                    (see <a href="../notes/tours_of_1826-27_note.php" target="_blank">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>The term <i>Red Book</i> was perhaps a family jest. According to the <span class="title-dictionary-OED"><i>OED</i></span>, 
                    the term applies to &#x201C;official books, usually distinguished by having a red binding, of political, administrative, or economic significance,&#x201D; 
                    a usage current since the fifteenth century (&#x201C;red book, n.1,&#x201D; <i>OED Online</i>, accessed <span class="date-2015-12-30">30 December 2015</span>), 
                    although, for the Ruskins, the term may have referred merely to the color. In later years, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> may also have intended these 
                    notebooks when using the term <i>Little Book</i> for manuscripts containing juvenilia composed by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> up to age ten&#x2014;a 
                    description that matches the Red Books accurately enough, since it was starting at about that age, in <span class="date-1829-1830">1829&#x2013;30</span>, 
                    when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> put aside the Red Books for larger, ledger&#x2010;like, half&#x2010;calf notebooks, some of which he dedicated solely to rough draft, 
                    and others solely to fair copy (although for a few years after <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did continue to exploit the Red Books for left&#x2010;over blank spaces 
                    in which to rough&#x2010;draft poetry and prose). (See letters of <span class="date-1850-02-01">1 February 1850</span> &#x005B;MSL 002/003/096&#x005D; and <span class="date-1850-02-02">2 February 1850</span> &#x005B;MSL 002/003/097&#x005D;, 
                    in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MSL002-003" target="_blank" class="inactive">Letters from <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>, 1829&#x2013;1862</a>, 
                    both letters also quoted in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#DEARDENPOEMS1850" target="_blank" class="inactive">Dearden, &#x201C;Production and Distribution of <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Poems</i> 1850&#x201D;</a>, 156&#x2013;57. 
                    It is possible, however, that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s usage of <i>Little Book</i> refers, not to a Red Book, but to 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span></a>, a small half&#x2010;calf notebook that

      </p>
      
      <p>The term <i>Red Book</i> stuck throughout <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s life. As late as <span class="date-1891">1891</span>, 
                    <a href="../notes/collingwood_w_g_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> employed the term in 
                    <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</span>, his descriptive bibliography 
                    compiled for <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</span></a>. 
                    Describing <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> as a &#x201C;ruled note&#x2010;book, bound in
                    red leather,&#x201D; roughly 6 by 4 inches, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> goes on to use the term <i>Red Book</i> 
                    as a shorthand to designate <span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span> and <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> as
                    conforming with this description (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:262;

      </p>
      
      <p>On <span class="date-1870-09-08">8 September 1870</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered the term when docketing 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a> as
                    &#x201C;Red book No. 1,&#x201D; <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> as 
                    &#x201C;Red book No. 2,&#x201D; and <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> as 
                    &#x201C;Red book No. 3.&#x201D; What prodded his selection and arrangement of these three of the seven Red Books is unrecorded,
                    but there are clues to his motives. On <span class="date-1870-08-09">9 August</span>, he had visited <a href="../notes/herne_hill_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span></a>,
                    where he &#x201C;put all in order,&#x201D; confiding to his diary that he &#x201C;worked once more in that old house, going through the room where
                    I lay in the morning looking at my first watercolour painting,&#x201D; and one wonders whether he found his juvenilia there, or whether the old
                    associations prompted him to unearth the Red Books on return to <span class="placeName-DENMARKHL">Denmark Hill</span>. The diary entry for <span class="date-1870-09-08">8 September</span> remarks only on the bad weather, but, on the
                    following Sunday (<span class="date-1870-09-11">11 September</span>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> looks back on a depressing week (&#x201C;for many a year&#x201D; not one &#x201C;so
                    miserable&#x201D;), during which he &#x201C;put much into order&#x201D; and &#x201C;read old poems of <span class="date-1848">1848</span>&#x201D;:
                    &#x201C;I have gained something in  <span class="date-1848-1870">these twenty&#x2010;two years</span>,&#x201D; he pronounced 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRDIARIES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRDIARIES-italic">Diaries</span></a> 700, 702).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reasons are also obscure for having chosen these particular Red Books to number, and for numbering them in this order. 
                    Curiously, he numbered them in reverse chronological order. &#x201C;No. 1,&#x201D; <a href="../apparatuses/msiv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a>, 
                    is plainly dated <span class="date-1828">1828</span> in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own boyhood hand; &#x201C;No. 2,&#x201D; 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a>, contains dates in his and his 
                    <span class="persName-MR">his mother</span>&#x02BC;s hands ranging from <span class="date-1826">1826</span> to <span class="date-1829">1829</span>; and &#x201C;No. 3,&#x201D; 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, is dated <span class="date-1826-1827">1826&#x2013;27</span> 
                    in his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>&#x02BC;s hand (see <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>: Date</a>,
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span>: Date</a>, 
                    and <a href="../apparatuses/msiv_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span>: Date</a>). 
                    Perhaps he gave first place to <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> because its chief work is the botanical poem, &#x201C;on the universe,&#x201D; 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                    for which had two possible reasons in <span class="date-1870">1870</span> to assign priority: his preference at this time to emphasize his boyhood talents for natural history; and obscure symbolic 
                    connections with <span class="persName-RLT">Rose La Touche (1848&#x2013;75)</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>In <span class="date-1869">1869</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had mined <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIII">MS III</span></a> 
                    for the boyhood poem <a href="../apparatuses/glenfarg_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; and &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                    which he reprinted in <span class="title-book-">The Queen of the Air</span> as an illustration of his &#x201C;birthright&#x201D; of &#x201C;art&#x2010;gift&#x201D; 
                    that came to him &#x201C;by Athena&#x02BC;s will, from the air of English country villages, and Scottish hills&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 19:396&#x2013;97, and see 283). 
                    In <span class="date-1869-09">September 1869</span>, <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span> sent him a cryptic message, 
                    by returning her copy of the book, enclosing only a weed and a rose leaf between its pages. An accidental face&#x2010;to&#x2010;face meeting between <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span> 
                    and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in <span class="date-1870-01">January 1870</span> only deepened the enigma and tension of their relations, 
                    and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began compiling notes for a book that would become his own contribution to the &#x201C;language of the flowers,&#x201D; 
                    <span class="title-book-JRPROSERPINA">Proserpina</span>. Their conflicted and rebarbative exchange continued throughout the year; however, a letter from <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span> 
                    gave <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> hope, and in <span class="date-1870-09">September 1870</span>, when he annotated the Red Books, he sought counsel to prepare a statement 
                    defining his legal, moral, and sexual status regarding his marriage&#x2014;a document that would later precipitate disastrous commentary from his former wife, nee
                    <span class="persName-ECG">Effie Chalmers Gray</span> (1828&#x2013;97), now Effie Millais (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINLATERYEARS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hilton, <i>John Ruskin: The Later Years</i></a>, 171&#x2013;73, 179). 
                    Perhaps, at this crisis, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found some sort of consolation in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/eudosia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</span></a>, which, as he would later summarize the poem 
                    in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, &#x201C;ascends from the rose to the oak&#x201D; in its first book 
                    (, 35:60). As the for the mysterious &#x201C;poems of <span class="date-1848">1848</span>,&#x201D; 
                    perhaps they related to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s marriage to <span class="persName-ECG">Effie</span> in that year, which also happened to be the year 
                    of <span class="persName-RLT">Rose</span>&#x02BC;s birth.
      </p>
      
      <p>Another possible explanation for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s treating <span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span> as &#x201C;Red book No. 1&#x201D; 
                    resides in his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span> having used a blank space in that notebook to compile his 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/jjr_msiv_poetry_list.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JJRLISTJRPOEMS">List of Published Poems, 1830&#x2013;46</span></a>. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> made the list 
                    in preparation for his affectionate task of collecting and printing the <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1850"><i>Poems</i> (1850)</span>, 
                    ending the list by proudly remembering the great men to whom <span class="persName-JR">his son</span> had been &#x201C;compared&#x201D;&#x2014;<span class="persName-JWG">Goethe</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span>, <span class="persName-IT">Isaac Taylor</span>, <span class="persName-EB">Edmound Burke</span>, and <span class="persName-DLL">Juvenal</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>Whatever the secret of his ordering of the Red Books in <span class="date-1870">1870</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own numbering may have misled him 
                    in <span class="date-1885">1885</span> when writing <span class="title-book-PRAETERITA-italic">Praeterita</span>. He misstated how many &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; 
                    he had completed of his <span class="title-lesson-JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>
