      <p><a href="../notes/shepherd_r_h_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</span></a> compiled the first professional <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> bibliography, 
                    <span class="title-bibliography-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><i>The Bibliography of Ruskin: A Bibliographical List Arranged in Chronological Order of the Published Writings in Prose and Verse of John Ruskin, M.A.</i></span>. 
                    It went through five editions:

         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>In addition, an <span class="placeName-USA">American</span> edition, published in <span class="placeName-NEWYORK">New York</span> by <span class="orgName-JWILEY">John Wiley and Sons</span> in <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, was based on the second edition. 
                    Of the <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span> editions, only the fifth carries a publisher&#x02BC;s imprint on the title page: 
                    <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>: / <span class="persName-ES">Elliot Stock</span>, 62, <span class="placeName-PATERNOSTER">Paternoster Row</span>. This edition was issued also in a large format, 
                    a &#x201C;special edition printed for the members of the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Society.&#x201D; Of the <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span> editions prior to the fifth&#x2014;certainly the first, and presumably the second through the fourth, as well&#x2014;were 
                    &#x201C;printed for private circulation,&#x201D; 
                    according to a clipping attached to a copy of the first edition held by the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Library, <span class="orgName-LANCASTERU">Lancaster</span>, and copies were available &#x201C;on application to the editor.&#x201D; See also the description of the publication 
                    in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 38:110. 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SHEPHERDDNB" target="_blank" class="inactive">Collins, <span class="title-SHEPERDDNB">&#x201C;Richard Herne Shepherd,&#x201D;</span></a> mentions that some of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> works were published by his brother, 
                    who ran a bookshop in <span class="placeName-HOLBORN">Holborn</span> under the name of <span class="persName-FH">Frank Hollings</span>, but this arrangement would not have come about prior to <span class="date-1892">1892</span> 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Paden, <span class="title-essay-TENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE">&#x201C;Tennyson&#x02BC;s <i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</i>, Shepherd, and Wise,&#x201D;</span> 117n</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>The first, third, and fifth editions appear to have been published without the compiler&#x02BC;s name anywhere indicated, whether on the title page or at the end of the introduction.</p> 
      
      <p>The first four editions carry a dedication to the artist, 
                    <a href="../notes/backhouse_h_f_note.php" target="_blank">Henry Backhouse</a> 
                    (his full name given as <span class="persName-HFB">Henry Fleetwood Backhouse</span>, starting with the third edition), &#x201C;who first
                    suggested to the compiler the idea of this little bibliography.&#x201D; Perhaps <span class="persName-HFB">Backhouse</span> originally helped subsidize the publication, 
                    since the dedication is dropped from the fifth edition, published by <span class="persName-ES">Elliot Stock</span>; 
                    or perhaps <span class="persName-HFB">Backhouse</span> was simply one of the avid <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> &#x201C;collectors&#x201D; to whom the author hoped the bibliography would &#x201C;prove useful,&#x201D; according to the clipping on the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> Library copy.
      </p>
      
      <p>Expansion and reissue of the bibliography was planned from the start, since, in the introduction to the first edition, the author anticipates &#x201C;more fortunate or more persistent research&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD1" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-bibliography-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><i>Bibliography of Ruskin</i> &#x005B;1st ed.&#x005D;</span></a>, vii). Already expanded for reissue a month later, 
                    the second edition names with thanks several individuals who supplied additional items for description 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD2" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-bibliography-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><i>Bibliography of Ruskin</i> &#x005B;2d ed.&#x005D;</span></a>, viii). The list attests that influential persons 
                    took an interest in the project.
      </p> 
      
      <p>Doubtless <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> had also hoped from the start to gain an acknowledgment from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                    himself. In a letter of <span class="date-1878-09-30">30 September 1878</span>, written apparently in response to receiving the first edition, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> answered <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>: &#x201C;So far from being distasteful to me, your
                    perfect reckoning up of me not only flatters my vanity extremely, but will be in
                    the highest degree useful to myself. But you know so much more about me than I
                    now remember about anything, that I can&#x02BC;t find a single thing to correct or
                    add&#x2014;glancing through at least. I will not say you have wasted your time;
                    but I may at least regret the quantity of trouble the book must have given you.
                    . . .&#x201D; In a second letter, dated <span class="date-1878-10-23">23 October
                        1878</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> acknowledges receipt
                    undoubtedly of the second edition: "I am very deeply grateful to you, as I am in
                    all duty bound, for this very curious record of myself. It will be of extreme
                    value to me in filling up what gaps I can in this patched coverlid of my life,
                    before it is draped over my coffin&#x2014;if it may be. I am especially glad to
                    have note of the letters to newspapers.&#x201D; These letters are printed as
                    loose inserts included with the second edition, at least as found in the Ruskin
                    Library&#x02BC;s copy, but various evidence confirms that the letters did originally
                    belong to that edition.<span id="">The American edition, published by Wiley and based
                        on the second edition, carries the <span class="date-1878-09-30">30 September</span> letter, printed opposite the
                        title page. In both the <span class="placeName-USA">American</span> and the <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span> second editions, this
                        letter is prefaced by the explanation: "The Compiler of this Bibliography
                        has had the honour to receive, in acknowledgment of a copy which he sent to
                        <span class="placeName-BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</span>, the following letter from <span class="persName-JR">Mr. Ruskin</span>." The second letter, as
                        suggested by its <span class="date-1878-10-23">23 October 1878</span> date, may likewise have accompanied the
                        second edition; however, the origin of its separate printed card is unclear.
                        The Bodleian Library copy of the second edition, as shown online in Google
                        Books, includes only the first <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> letter.</span><br><br> It is no accident,
                    therefore, that the second edition carried <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> name in print, as did the
                    fourth, which likewise involved self&#x2010;advertisement using <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> letters (see
                    below).
      </p> 
      
      <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> comment in the October letter about his interest in &#x201C;the letters to newspapers&#x201D; refers to a particular interest of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span>. In the introduction to the first edition of the bibliography, 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> expressed his special solicitude to track down the public letters, and the second edition does 
                    contain additional entries of this kind. One wonders if <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was planning to collect these ephemera; if so, he was trumped by <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburna</span>, who with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> support collected 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> public letters to newspapers in  
                    <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINARROWS-italic">Arrows of the Chase</span>, published in <span class="date-1880">1880</span> (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 34:xxxviii).<span id=""><span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>
                        prints <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> letters to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> in <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINARROWS-italic">Arrows of the Chase</span>, noting that the letters are &#x201C;given in the List of &#x2018;Mr. <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> Publications,&#x2019; 
                        printed at the end of his <i>The Bibliography of Dickens</i>, <span class="date-1880">1880</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 34:537). The texts of both letters, <span class="date-1878-09">September</span> and <span class="date-1878-10">October 1878</span>, are indeed 
                        found in the back matter of <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#DICKENSBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-bibliography-DICKENSBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><i>The Bibliography of Dickens</i></span></a>), 
                        following numerous complimentary squibs from journals about <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> bibliography. <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> remark in <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINARROWS-italic">Arrows of the Chase</span> suggests that he took the texts of the letters 
                        from this source and knew nothing about their prior printing to accompany the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> bibliography. The list printed at the back of the <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span> bibliography advertises specifically the fourth edition 
                        of the bibliography, which is the one other edition besides the second to bear <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> name in print.</span><br><br></p>
      
      <p>In each edition of the bibliography except the last, which drops the author&#x02BC;s introduction, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> dwells on his care: &#x201C;the materials for &#x005B;the bibliography&#x02BC;s&#x005D; compilation have taken many years to collect, 
                    and much anxious labour has been spent on its preparation and arrangement. No entry has in any case been made at second&#x2010;hand; but always with the actual book, pamphlet,
                    magazine, or journal described lying before the compiler.&#x201D; Indeed, the thoroughness of Shepherd&#x02BC;s sleuthing is impressive. Entries on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> early publications are in some cases annotated 
                    with quotations identifying or legitimating the piece. For example,  <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> authenticates his entry for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> two <span class="date-1834">1834</span> essays published in <span class="title-periodical-MAGAZINEOFNATURALHISTORY-italic">The Magazine of Natural History</span>, 
                    <span class="title-essay-RUSKINENQUIRIES">&#x201C;Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>,&#x201D;</span> 
                    and <span class="title-essay-RUSKINMONTBLANC">&#x201C;Facts and Considerations on the Strata of <span class="geogName-MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</span>,&#x201D;</span> by quoting a footnote from the so&#x2010;called 
                    <i>Instructions in Use of the Rudimentary Series</i> for the Drawing Schools at <span class="orgName-OXFORDU">Oxford</span> (<span class="date-1872">1872</span>), where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remarks that &#x201C;Mr. <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span> was the first
                        literary patron who sent words of mine to be actually set up in print, in his
                    <span class="title-periodical--italic">Magazine of Natural History</span>, when I was sixteen&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD2" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-bibliography-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><i>Bibliography of Ruskin</i></span> &#x005B;2d ed.&#x005D;</a>, 1&#x2013;2; see also

                    Similarly, in the entry for <span class="title-essay-JRPOETRYOFARCHITECTURE1839-italic">The Poetry of Architecture</span> (<span class="date-1839">1839</span>), <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> appends a nugget from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="date-1878">1878</span> essay on 
                    <span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span>, <span class="title-essay-RUSKINMYFIRSTEDITOR">&#x201C;My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence.&#x201D;</span> <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> quotes: &#x201C;the series of essays written for the <i>Architectural Magazine</i>, 
                    under the signature of <span class="persName-KP">Kata Phusin</span>, contain sentences nearly as well put together as any I have done since&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD2" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-bibliography-RUSKINBIBLIOGRAPHYSHEPHERD"><i>Bibliography of Ruskin</i></span> &#x005B;2d ed.&#x005D;</a>, 2; see also

                        <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> not only references an obscure footnote; he must have obtained the pamphlet itself with some difficulty, it having never been issued for sale, but printed only for
                    students of the Drawing Schools (perhaps obtained from <span class="persName-HFB">Backhouse</span> or one of the contributors thanked in the introduction). <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> essay on <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> was likewise somewhat obscure. 
                    Familiar nowadays to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> scholars, as it was reprinted in <span class="date-1885">1885</span> in <span class="title-anthology-RUSKINOLDROAD-italic">On the Old Road</span>, in <span class="date-1878">1878</span> the piece would have been accessible to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    only as a preface to <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison&#x02BC;s</span> memoir, recently published in the <span class="title-periodical--italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. (In fact, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> essay on <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> appeared in <span class="date-1878-04">April 1878</span>, 
                    and <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> first issue of the bibliography later that year in September, one wonders if it was <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> tribute to his first editor 
                    that first inspired <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> project.) Similarly, in his edition of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning&#x02BC;s</span> juvenilia, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> cites journal and encyclopedia articles authenticating the poet&#x02BC;s early volumes, 
                    and those essays, too, may have prompted <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> undertaking
