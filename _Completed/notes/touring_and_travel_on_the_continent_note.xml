                        for middle&#x2010;class British travel by historians studying the opening of <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>,

                        since more rapid crossings were made possible by the rise of steam packet lines. The steam packets accommodated large excursion parties 
                        along with individual travelers, providing amenities such as food and drink and even entertainment, with music performance being common onboard

                        For travelers of modest means, the steam lines greatly increased the efficiency, reliability, and carrying capacity, improvements that were critical 
                        for travelers who could take holidays from employment only on a limited budget and for definite periods&#x2014;a point expressly made

                    <p>The slowness and obstinance of French postilions were decried by English travelers, justly or unjustly, 
                        from the <date notBefore="1701" notAfter="1900">eighteenth century through the nineteenth</date>, and their extraordinary appearance

                        objected to post horses taken &#x201C;from the field, the cart, or the plough&#x201D; and presenting &#x201C;a worse appearance 
                        than the most miserable hawker&#x02BC;s cart in the streets of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>&#x201D;, 
                        while the postilion cut no &#x201C;less extraordinary figure than his horses. His enormous boots, weighing from 5 to 7 pounds each, 
                        in which there is room for two legs of ordinary size&#x2014;his powdered hair and long pigtail&#x2014;his enormous whip, 
                        in the smacking of which he makes the most wonderful evolutions over his head, and the most terrible noise that can be imagined, 
                        and by the regulation of which, on principles known to themselves, he apprises the postmaster as he enters a town or village,

                    <p>On the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of 1833</ref>, the young travelers soon got into the spirit of English bemusement 
                        and exasperation over the figure of the French postilion&#x2014;<persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>, in the satirical essay,

                        and his cousin, <persName corresp="MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, in her travel diary. At the start of the tour, Mary 
                        was "much amused with the postillion cracking his whip very loud" to encourage his "most miserable looking animals", but she soon 
                        professed weariness over "waiting a long time as usual" for horses as "for every thing in this country". In a set piece flavored 
                        with Dickensian irony, she narrates the upset caused by an incompetent postilion who nearly ran their horses into a shop, 
                        bringing a crowd into the street to surround the carriage, and who was replaced by a postilion affecting such nonchalance that, 
                        "with the greatest coolness . . . [he] stopped 20 times to sort something or other" with the tackle. In general, she concludes 
                        disapprovingly, "[i]n France and Belgium, the postillions stop in the middle of every stage, if only five miles, to get beer or brandy", 
                        cracking their whips on approach to a place where someone would always bring them their refreshment. 
                        and the postilion who drove them out of <placeName corresp="AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix</placeName> spent the journey &#x201C;smoking and sleeping&#x201D;.
