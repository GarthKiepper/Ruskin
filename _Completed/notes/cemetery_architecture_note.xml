                <p>When the Ruskins visited the <placeName type="building" corresp="#FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery</placeName> in <ref type="gloss_contextual" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_glosses_contextual#FRANCFURTGLOSS"><placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfurt am Main</placeName></ref> 
                    in <date when="1833">1833</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName> perhaps gained his first exposure to the new urban cemeteries that were starting to replace the traditional parish churchyard in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> and <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                    although by that time he had also visited <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> with his family and therefore may have viewed that city&#x02BC;s new <placeName type="building" corresp="#STJAMESSCEMETERY">St. James&#x02BC;s Cemetery</placeName> 
                    opened in <date when="1829">1829</date>. Responding both to hygienic concerns made pressing by rapid urban growth that led to overcrowded city burial places and 
                    to the need for nondenominational alternatives to <orgName corresp="#CHURCHOFENGLAND">Anglican</orgName> parish churchyards, the new cemeteries were operated by joint stock companies.</p>
                
                <p>Architecturally, these cemeteries presented a significant focus for neoclassicism until that taste was displaced by Gothic Revival influences in <date notBefore="1834" notAfter="1867">mid&#x2010;century</date>. Entered via a massive gatehouse, 
                    often modeled on the Greek Doric propylaeum, the grounds were conceived as a classical <placeName corresp="#ELYSIUM">Elysium</placeName>, inspired by the Arcadian landscape tradition in painting and estate gardening. 
                    Another classical model was the &#x201C;city of the dead&#x201D; or necropolis, drawn from <placeName corresp="ETRUSCANS">Etruscan</placeName> tomb complexes and (although quite different from the Etruscan model in origin and conception) Roman catacombs. 
                    At the same time, since the new cemetery designs arose well into the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1899">nineteenth century</date>, the non&#x2010;classical taste for the picturesque guided the layout 
                    of walks, drives, and the botanically diverse plantings. Thus, the English gardening tradition combined with classical monuments, even in Continental new cemeteries. 
                    The hugely influential design combining these elements was the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PERELACHAISE">Cimeti&#x00E8;re du P&#x00E8;re&#x2010;Lachaise</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, established in <date when="1804">1804</date>, 
                    and created by <persName corresp="#ATBRONGNIART">Alexandre&#x2010;Th&#x00E9;odore Brongniart</persName> (<date notBefore="1739" notAfter="1813">1739&#x2013;1813</date>) 
                    under the patronage of <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon Bonaparte</persName>. (Apparently, the Ruskins visited <placeName type="building" corresp="#PERELACHAISE">P&#x00E8;re&#x2010;Lachaise</placeName> 
                    on their way home from the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of 1833</ref>, 
                    since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> planned to write about the cemetery in the <title type="composite" corresp="JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>; see 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php#ACCOUNTOCPERELACHAISE"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>.) 
                    In <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, cemetery architecture eventually came under the influence of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="loudon_j_c_note.php"><persName corresp="#JCL">John Claudius Loudon</persName></ref> (<date notBefore="1783" notAfter="1843">1783&#x2013;1843</date>), 
                    who modified the combined Arcadian and picturesque tastes that had governed the garden cemetery, by enforcing a characteristically comprehensive plan 
                    that was hygienically practical for disposal of the dead yet also morally instructive for the living observer. <persName corresp="#JCL">Loudon</persName>&#x02BC;s treatise,
