                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was a key figure in arranging for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s most significant 
                    early professional publication as a poet. (Technically, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s public debut as a poet occurred earlier, but less auspiciously, under the editorship of

                    For the same issue of the annual for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> also commissioned a new poem by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-SALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>, to accompany an engraving after a topographical scene by

      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was born in the Scottish border county of <span class="placeName-ROXBURGHSHIRE">Roxburghshire</span>. After brief involvement in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> journalism, he emigrated in <span class="date-1820">1820</span> to <span class="placeName-SAFRICA">South Africa</span>, 
                    where he worked as a journalist and writer, librarian, and teacher, returning to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. There, he grew important for his work on behalf of the abolitionist cause, 
                    and he became known for his poetry evoking rural life in <span class="placeName-SAFRICA">South Africa</span>. On <span class="date-1834-06-28">28 June 1834</span>, the day following his signing of the official proclamation ending slavery in the British Empire, 
                    and thus consummating his life&#x02BC;s work dedicated to abolition, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> experienced distress that he interpreted as a &#x201C;crumb of bread&#x201D; going down &#x201C;the wrong throat,&#x201D; 
                    but that proved to be a sign of advancing tuberculosis, leading to his death before the end of the year 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 241).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>It was while making his way as an editor in the <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary scene of the <span class="date-1826-1833">late 1820s and early 1830s</span> that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> encountered the Ruskin family. 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> became editor of <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>  
                    in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, starting his responsibilities with the volume for <span class="date-1829">1829</span> 
                    (that is, the volume that became available for purchase in <span class="date-1828-10-1828-11">October or Novemeber 1828</span>, intended for <span class="date-1828-12-1829-01">the holiday season of 1828&#x2013;29</span>). 
                    The annual had been acquired in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> by the young publishing firm of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>, from its founding publisher; 
                    and <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> released their first issue (the volume for <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, published in <span class="date-1827-11">November 1827</span>) 
                    under the editorship of <span class="persName-CK">Charles Knight</span>. When <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> took over, he remained editor until his death in <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span>, 
                    having already prepared the volume for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>&#x2014;the volume in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems appeared&#x2014;and  
                    and sent it to press in <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 183, 244; 
                    &#x201C;Index of Editors and Publishers of British Literary Annuals Published 1823&#x2013;1830,&#x201D; in 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Harris, ed., <i>&#x201C;Forget Me Not&#x201D; Archive</i></a>). 
                    During his illness in this final year of his editorship, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was assisted by 
                    <a href="../notes/inglis_henry_note.php" target="_blank">Henry D. Inglis (1795&#x2013;1835)</a>, 
                    and therefore the Ruskins may have had some contact with this writer and editor, as well, in preparing <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s first poems for a widely distributed public venue.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Precisely how <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s acquaintance with the Ruskins came about is unknown. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s later reminiscences of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> are subordinated to wry rhetorical purposes. First, in the <span class="date-1878">1878</span> <span class="title-essay-RUSKINMYFIRSTEDITOR">&#x201C;My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence,&#x201D;</span> 
         <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> appears as prelude to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s tribute to 
                    <a href="../notes/harrison_w_h_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">W. H. Harrison (ca. 1792&#x2013;1878)</a>, 
                    the poet and editor with whom <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained a much longer professional relationship, 
                    and who succeeded <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> as one of the stewards of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> for <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>. 
                    Second, in <span class="date-1885-1889">1885&#x2013;89</span>, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s autobiography, 
                    <span class="title-autobiography-PRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s story is involved in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s self-irony and satire about his fledgling career as a poet, 
                    a vocation that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ultimately rejected, but that his father cherished and had attempted to nourish in company with men like <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>As <span class="persName-RV">Rudolphe Vigne</span> points out, in his monograph on <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>, the association between <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and the Ruskins would have rested on their shared Scottish heritage and literary interests, 
                    and <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> may have centered his high regard more on <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> than on <span class="persName-JR">John</span>. 
                    To document this friendship, <span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> has uncovered a letter (unfortunately undated), 
                    in which <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> mentions &#x201C;my friend <span class="persName-JJR">Mr Ruskin</span> of the house of <span class="orgName-RUSKINETAL">Domecq and Co.</span>, . . . the greatest sherry merchants in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. I have drunk at <span class="persName-JJR">Mr Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s table 
                    sherry 80 years old, and which sells at 26 shillings a bottle&#x201D;
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 189). 
                    A key figure in these connections may have been <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> (<span class="date-1790">1790</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1876">1876</span>), 
                    one of the founding partners of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>. The firm&#x02BC;s counting house was located around the corner from the premises of 
                    <span class="orgName-RUSKINETAL">Telford, Ruskin, &#x0026; Domecq</span>, and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> would have shared Elder&#x02BC;s artistic interests 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINEARLYYEARS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hilton, <span class="title-biography-RUSKINEARLYYEARS"><i>John Ruskin: The Early Years</i></span></a>, 29; and see 
                    <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>For <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, a more compelling figure in these connections may have been his cousin, 
                    <a href="../notes/richardson_charles_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Charles Thomas Richardson (1811&#x2013;34)</a>, 
                    who was employed by <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> as a shop boy. (<span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> is incorrect to number this &#x201C;young shop-boy, <span class="persName-CTR">Charles Richardson</span>,&#x201D; among the Scots in this publishing network. Charles did not belong 
                    to Ruskin&#x02BC;s Richardson cousins from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, but to his Richardson cousins from <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>, near <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 186&#x005D;.) <span class="persName-JR">John</span> admired <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> as an older cousin, who presented the boy with his first copy of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>. 
                    In <span class="title-autobiography-PRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembers that, &#x201C;on Sundays,&#x201D; <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> &#x201C;always brought a volume or two in his pocket to show us 
                    the character of &#x005B;the firm&#x02BC;s&#x005D; most ambitious publications; especially choosing, on my behalf, any which chanced to contain good engravings,&#x201D; 
                    and he writes that &#x201C;we all took&#x201D; an interest &#x201C;in the embossed and gilded&#x201D; annual
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:91). 
                    The gift of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> earned no approval from <span class="persName-MR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s mother</span>, however, 
                    who on <span class="date-1829-10-31">31 October 1829</span> wrote to apprise <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> that &#x201C;<span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> has given <span class="persName-JR">John</span> a Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering,&#x201D; 
                    and who concluded that &#x201C;upon the whole &#x005B;the publication&#x005D; does not improve&#x201D; the mind: &#x201C;the plates are well done but they are not interesting,&#x201D; 
                    and &#x201C;the tales are horrible enough,&#x201D; and &#x201C;the poetry very so I think&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 208).
      </p>
      
      <p>This copy of the annual presented by <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> in <span class="date-1829-10-21-1829-10-31">late October 1829</span> would probably have been the recently published volume &#x201C;for <span class="date-1830">1830</span>,&#x201D; one of the volumes edited by <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> 
                    (see <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>). 
                    It contained contributions by his longtime friend, 
                    <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank"> (ca. <span class="date-1770-1835">1770&#x2013;1835</span>)</a>, 
                    whom <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was likely responsible for introducing personally to the Ruskins at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, 
                    sometime between <span class="date-1832-01-14-1832-02-19">14 January and 19 February 1832</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, this connection proved significant for the Ruskins&#x2014;at least as significant as another great man with whom 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> remained more closely associated in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s memory&#x2014;namely, 
                    <a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</a>, to whom 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> introduced <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as a prodigy 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:93, 34:96&#x2013;97).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> did admit <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> to his circle, as <span class="persName-RV">Vigne</span> confirms (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <span class="title-biography-VIGNEPRINGLE"><i>Thomas Pringle</i></span></a>, 191&#x2013;92), 
                    but we have only <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s much later, barbed accounts of the episode, wherein the boy allegedly failed to flatter <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> adequately about the poetry of his topographical volume, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                    and instead found greater interest in the engraved vignettes for the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition, and in the pictures on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s walls. 
                    Accordingly, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> chided his charge for failing to attend to the conversation of great men.
                    The anecdote may or may not be plausible, but a more significant and fundamental question concerns the motivation and outcome of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s introduction of the fourteen&#x2010; or fifteen&#x2010;year old boy wonder 
                    to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s famous palace of art, <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span>, where the poet had entertained the literati of Regency and early Victorian <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>
