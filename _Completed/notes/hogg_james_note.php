      <p>Scottish poet and fiction writer. <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was familiarly known as the &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span>,&#x201D; owing to his youth spent as a shepherd in <span class="geogName-ETTRICKFOREST">Ettrick Forest</span>. 
                    Later, when a successful writer, he returned to the area, dividing his time between <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> literary life and a farm, <span class="placeName-ALTRIVE">Altrive</span>, 
                    in the <span class="geogName-YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</span> in the <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scottish Borders</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, <span class="title-biography-HUGHESHOGGLIFE-italic">James Hogg</span></a>, 134, 150, 153). 
                    The farm lay near to <span class="placeName-ABBOTSFORD">Abbotsford</span>, the residence of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s friend, the novelist <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, in 
                    <span class="placeName-SELKIRSHIRE">Selkirkshire</span>. If the BrontÃ« siblings viewed <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    as a colorful, colloquial contributor to the dramatized repartee 
                    of the <span class="title-series-NOCTESAMBROSIANAE">&#x201C;Noctes Ambrosianae&#x201D;</span> of <span class="title-magazine-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE-italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Edinburgh Magazine</span>&#x2014;an 
                    influence on the children&#x02BC;s collaborative and competitive writing, and an encouragement 
                    to &#x201C;bravado&#x201D; and &#x201C;swagger&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ALEXANDERREADERSANDWRITERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Alexander, <span class="title-essay-ALEXANDERREADERSANDWRITERS">&#x201C;Readers and Writers&#x201D;</span></a>, 62, 67)&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    knew <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> as a contributor 
                    to the <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a>, 
                    such as <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-magazine-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING-italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</span></a>, 
                    and an affirmation of benign paternity associated with the georgic and poetic landscape of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>.
                
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> met the Ruskin family personally sometime between January and March <span class="date-1832-01-1832-03">1832</span>, 
                    when he undertook his first visit to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                    (specifically, probably between <span class="date-1832-01-14-1832-02-19">14 January and 19 February</span>, 
                    when <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> was not away from home, traveling to customers &#x005B;see 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL-italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></a>, 1: 260 n. 9&#x005D;, 
                    and even more likely between <span class="date-1832-01-14-1832-02-08">14 January and 8 February</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s birthday, as explained below).
                    In a later letter thanking <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> for his hospitality, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    mentions meeting <span class="persName-MR">Mrs. Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, 
                    but not <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin, <span class="persName-MBR">Mary Richardson</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s purpose in coming to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                    was to arrange for a collected edition of his prose fiction, the <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span>.
                    His mission was tied to a significant phenomenon in British book publishing of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> and <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                    the production of accessibly priced, but well produced, uniform editions of collected works of modern British writers.
                
      </p> 
      
      <p><span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> had long sought to publish a collected edition of his tales, which would complement his two collected editions of poetry, 
                    but he was now emboldened by the success of a new plan pursued by his friend, 
                    <a href="../notes/scott_walter_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott (1771&#x2013;1832)</span></a>, 
                    and by <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s publisher, <span class="orgName-CADELLROBERT">Robert Cadell</span>. 
                    Hoping to tap into a popular market, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> and <span class="orgName-CADELLROBERT">Cadell</span> conceived the <i>magnum opus</i> edition of the Waverley novels, 
                    which offered consumers monthly volumes of accessibly priced, yet handsomely produced, uniform volumes of the novels, each freshened with a new preface by the author, 
                    and each embellished with a few engraved illustrations.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>At the very modest price of five or six shillings per volume, the success of the scheme depended on high&#x2010;volume sales to a broad market. 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s venture, which began in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, proved so successful that other publishers soon repeated the experiment by profitably 
                    reprinting the works of other popular authors. The marketing plan was supported by innovations in printing, especially mass&#x2010;producible illustration using steel engraving, 
                    which supported a boom trade in <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a> aimed at the middle class. 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself would debut in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> as a writer for this trade. 
                
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publisher, <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">James Cochrane</span>, had produced such an edition, collecting <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> British novelists, 
                    and <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span> promised <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> the services of that edition&#x02BC;s well&#x2010;known illustrator, 
                    <a href="../notes/cruikshank_george_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-GC">George Cruikshank</span> (<span class="date-1792-1878">1792&#x2013;1878</span>)</a>. 
                    Regrettably, the venture came to grief because <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span> went bankrupt. 
                    <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span> ultimately managed to produce one volume of the projected edition of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s tales, 
                    a volume that contained not only three of the tales but also (and a precursor to what became a characteristic feature in collected editions of modern writers) an 
                    autobiographical &#x201C;Memoir&#x201D;  by the author; a portrait engraving of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, which served as the volume&#x02BC;s frontispiece 
                    (created by <span class="persName-CFENGRAVER">Charles Fox</span> &#x005B;<span class="date-1794-1849">1794&#x2013;1849</span>&#x005D;, an artist who 
                    who had contributed illustrations to <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <i>magnum opus</i> edition); and a cut by <span class="persName-GC">Cruikshank</span> illustrating one of the tales 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, <span class="title-biography-HUGHESHOGGLIFE-italic">James Hogg</span></a>, 222&#x2010;23, 265&#x2010;66, 281, 287; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESINTROHOGGALTRIVE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, introduction to Hogg, <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span></a>, xvii, xxxiii, xxxiv&#x2010;xliii).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>
                    Later, when <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> returned to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> following <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span>&#x02BC;s failure, 
                    the author negotiated with a <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span> publisher, <span class="orgName-BLACKIESON">Blackie &#x0026; Son</span>, who arranged for a reprint series of the fiction, 
                    by employing the <span class="placeName-GLASGOW">Glasgow</span> system of &#x201C;numbers&#x201D; publishing. In this scheme, books were published in segments, 
                    issued monthly in paper covers, so that the consumer of modest means could compile complete volumes over time with small outlays 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, introduction to Hogg, <span class="title-collected_letters-HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3-italic">Letters, 1832&#x2013;1835</span></a>, xxxix&#x2013;xl). 
                    In <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s case, the resulting six volumes of fiction published by <span class="orgName-BLACKIESON">Blackie &#x0026; Son</span> proved a far cry from the uniform edition of the 
                    <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span>, modeled on <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <i>magnum opus</i> edition.
                
      </p> 
      
      <p>These ambitions and disappointments concerning publishing arrangements are relevant to the Ruskins&#x02BC; acquaintance with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, 
                    because the writer became embroiled in these difficulties in the years leading up to 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own introduction to the professional <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary world as 
                    &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>&#x201D; 
                    In <span class="date-1829">1829</span> and <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, two poems by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based on his <a href="../apparatuses/description_of_skiddaw_and_lake_derwent_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-RUSKINSKIDDAWANDDERWENT">&#x201C;Description of Skiddaw and Lake Derwent&#x201D;</span></a>  
                    had already appeared in the <span class="title-magazine-SPIRITUALTIMES-italic">Spiritual Times</span>; however, this magazine, which was published by the Ruskins&#x02BC; clergyman and <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s tutor, 
                    <a href="../notes/andrews_edward_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span> (1787&#x2013;1841)</a>, 
                    amounted almost to a family affair. The boy&#x02BC;s continuing facile and prolific poetry composition gave promise of a more ambitious and prominent staging of his talents, 
                    and doubtless <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was keenly observant to learn how publishers operated.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>As <span class="persName-GH">Gillian Hughes</span> remarks, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s disappointed expectations reflect the transition between publishing in the age of <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> and 
                    the more volatile and confusing print culture in the age of <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>. 
                    <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span>&#x02BC;s collapse, which occurred only <span class="date-1832">six years after the bank failures of 1826</span> 
                    had already ruined many publishers, represented the riskier possibilities 
                    in publishing that were opening up alongside apparently solid houses like <span class="orgName-MURRAY">John Murray</span> and <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> presents an exemplary figure for authorship during this transitional period. 
                    He was willing to experiment with new ways to reach his public; and despite his relative isolation on his <span class="placeName-ALTRIVE">Altrive</span> farm, 
                    he had become a literary celebrity by embracing new modes of publication. At the same time, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> expressed doubts about the effects of cheap publication 
                    on &#x201C;legitimate literature.&#x201D; His attitudes were colored not only by his personal professional triumphs and disappointments 
                    in his ongoing struggle to support his family&#x2010;high fame coupled with great risk, as mirrored in the career of his more august friend, <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x2013;but also 
                    by his hardening Toryism, which resulted from adverse personal experiences during the country&#x02BC;s disturbances over the <span class="date-1832">1832</span> Reform Bill 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, introduction to Hogg, <span class="title-collected_letters-HUGHESINTROHOGGLETTERSVOL3-italic">Letters, 1832&#x2013;1835</span></a>, xli, xxxviii&#x2013;xxxix).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Meanwhile, in <span class="date-1832-01-1832-03">the first quarter of 1832</span>, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> visit 
                    was pleasurable and flattering, as the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span> was widely feted as a literary celebrity&#x2014;especially, 
                    though not exclusively, among Scottish residents. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was known for his poetry and fiction, but he was perhaps most famous for his association with a character, the &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Shepherd</span>,&#x201D; 
                    in the <span class="title-series-NOCTESAMBROSIANAE-italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</span> series in the <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> periodical, 
                    <span class="title-magazine-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE-italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Magazine</span>. In his first visit to the metropolis, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was ready to take control over his own public persona. 
                    He had already unsettled the complacency of <span class="title-magazine-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE-italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s</span> by pursuing 
                    the offer by a <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publisher, <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span>, 
                    to take on the edition of the <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span>. Now he sent contributions to a new <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> periodical, <span class="title-magazine-FRASERMAGAZINE-italic">Fraser&#x02BC;s Magazine</span>, 
                    which had set out in <span class="date-1830">1830</span> to rival specifically <span class="title-magazine-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE-italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Magazine</span>. 
                    The connection with <span class="title-magazine-FRASERMAGAZINE-italic">Fraser&#x02BC;s</span> was especially gratifying for <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    in that the metropolitan periodical did not balk at his irreverence and bawdiness&#x2014;always 
                    an impediment in Calvinist <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">North Britain</span> to granting <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> his due respect as a sophisticated writer 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, <span class="title-biography-HUGHESHOGGLIFE-italic">James Hogg</span></a>, 233&#x2013;34).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>During <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s visit to <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                    the circle of Scottish literati who were established in the city had already grown alarmed over the probable state of 
                    <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span>&#x02BC;s solvency, so <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s friends attempted to raise funds for the writer. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> refused charity, but he consented to a scheme for publication by subscription of a new deluxe edition of 
                    <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span> (<span class="date-1813-1819">1813&#x2013;19</span>), the poem that had first established his reputation. 
                    To this effort, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> subscribed generously 
                    with a donation of &#x00A3;20, asking <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> in a letter of <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span> for the honor of being the first subscriber 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes, <span class="title-biography-HUGHESHOGGLIFE-italic">James Hogg</span></a>, 251&#x2013;52, 266;

                    It was surely no accident that the date of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s donation was his son&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</span>. 
                    Symbolically, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was investing his son in modern Caledonian poetry. Moreover, the projected form of the book, a 
                    deluxe edition of an established modern classic, reflected the success of another illustrated edition of modern poetry, 
                    which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is believed to have received on his <span class="date-1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</span>âthe <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of

                    which was illustrated by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, and others. 
                    The Ruskins were thus taking a direct part in a distinctly contemporary mode of book production aimed at politely learned middle&#x2010;class consumers like themselves. 
                    Ultimately, the  <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span> venture presented a stark contrast with the ongoing best&#x2010;seller status of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY-italic">Italy</span> and 
                    his <span class="date-1834">1834</span> collected <span class="title-collected_poems-ROGERSPOEMS-italic">Poems</span>, also illustrated by <span class="persName-TSP">Turner</span>.

      <p>Confessing in a reply to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> that he felt &#x201C;queer&#x201D; accepting the donation but admitting to his pressing financial need, 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was emboldened by the gift to write to <span class="persName-JGL">John Gibson Lockhart</span> (<span class="date-1794-1854">1794&#x2013;1854</span>), the influential editor and the son&#x2010;in&#x2010;law of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, 
                    nudging him with ideas for the edition. (The impetus for the deluxe <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span> edition was formally urged by the prestigious 
                    <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> firm headed by the Scotsman, <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>, 
                    for whom <span class="persName-JGL">Lockhart</span> worked as the editor of the <span class="title-magazine-QUARTERLYREVIEW-italic">Quarterly Review</span>.) 
                    Cannily, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> insinuated terms for the book, which, he wrote, &#x201C;should be a work something like The Keepsake 
                    with fewer ornaments yet so as to make it a drawing&#x2010;room book&#x201D;

                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s description shows that he wanted to take advantage of the fashion 
                    for <a href="../notes/annuals_note.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">literary annuals</a>, 
                    publications meant to appeal to middle&#x2010;class consumers as presenting allegedly quality samplings of the nation&#x02BC;s art and literature, 
                    while also constituting showy but accessibly priced luxury items for the &#x201C;drawing&#x2010;room.&#x201D; 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s citing the <span class="title-periodical-THEKEEPSAKE-italic">Keepsake</span> as an example was strategic, since this annual was among the costliest and most elegant of the many crowding the market 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hunnisett, <span class="title-essay-HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED-italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</span></a>,

                    As a potential illustrator for the deluxe edition, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> dropped the name of the popular artist, <span class="persName-JMARTIST">John Martin</span> (<span class="date-1789">1789&#x2010;1854</span>), 
                    whom <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> met personally during his <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> visit, and whose work he had encountered and admired in the annuals as well as in the mezzotints by which <span class="persName-JMARTIST">Martin</span>&#x02BC;s apocalyptic 
                    fantasies were widely disseminated. <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> also mentioned &#x201C;some others who would do &#x005B;an illustration&#x005D; for me <i>con amore</i>

                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> appreciated the visual arts, and througout his <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> visit, 
                    he sought opportunities to view exhibitions and converse with artists

      </p>
      
      <p>Additional subscription funds were collected and eventually sent to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, and <span class="persName-JMARTIST">Martin</span> 
                    did create and exhibit a watercolor drawing based on the tale of <span class="title-poem-HOGGKILMENY-italic">Kilmeny</span>, 
                    which forms part of the bards&#x02BC; competition in <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span>; however, 
                    the planned book ultimately went the way of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s other disappointments resulting from his <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> venture, 
                    and the deluxe edition was never published

                    Months later in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> would add his name to another list for publication by subscription&#x2013;this one 
                    for the <span class="title-collected_sketches-PROUTSKETCHES-italic">Facsimiles of Sketches in Flanders and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span></span> (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>) 
                    by <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">Samuel Prout (1783&#x2010;1852)</a>

                    This publication did come to fruition, and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was doubtless flattered to be listed among subscribers who included members of the aristocracy, 
                    well&#x2010;known artists, and other successful professional men. Earlier in the year, he must have been equally proud to lead the way 
                    among prosperous Scottish <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> merchants in supporting <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s book, an elegant expression of modern Caledonian poetry. 
                    Nonetheless, while <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s book proved auspicious in helping <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to envision his own place in the British print production of art and poetry in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> 
                    (see <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>), 
                    the example of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s ill&#x2010;fated <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span> subscription edition must have worked in part as a cautionary tale. 
                    As a representative publishing project of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, the fading away of the deluxe <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span> 
                    along with the compromising of the <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span> edition poses a inverse complement to <span class="persName-TBM">Thomas Macaulay</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    encomium to the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY-italic">Italy</span>, which, were it &#x201C;dug up in some <span class="placeName-POMPEII">Pompeii</span> or <span class="placeName-HERCULANEUM">Herculaneum</span>

                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was well situated to lend influence. Since <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, he had edited the annual,

                    It is noteworthy that the Ruskins&#x02BC; relationship with <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> appears to have been in place two years earlier than the editor&#x02BC;s adoption of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first poems

      <p><span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> were contrasting personalities. 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> implored <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> to contribute to the first two volumes that he edited of <span class="title-magazine-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING-italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</span>, 
                    those for <span class="date-1829">1829</span> and <span class="date-1830">1830</span>

                    Yet, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> rejected some of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s submissions that the editor considered &#x201C;<i>too broad</i>&#x201D; in humor, 
                    for <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> vowed &#x201C;to admit not a single expression &#x005B;into the annual&#x005D; which would call up a blush in the cheek of the most delicate female if reading aloud to a mixt company&#x201D;

                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> retaliated with satirical verses on the editors of annuals, declaring, in an <span class="date-1831">1831</span> poem for <span class="title-magazine-BLACKWOODMAGAZINE-italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Magazine</span>,

                    124&#x2010;26, 138&#x2010;39, 309&#x2010;10). But the poem in these volumes that is particularly germane to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is <span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Minstrel Boy,&#x201D;</span> 
                    which presents an image of precocious youthful poetry in naturalized terms. <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> composed the poem at <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s behest 
                    to complement an engraved genre subject by <span class="persName-CRL">C. R. Leslie</span> (<span class="date-1794-1859">1794&#x2010;1859</span>)
                    depicting (in <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s words, describing the picture to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>) &#x201C;a boy of perhaps 7 or 8 years of age with a shepherds pipe in his hand 
                    &#x0026; a highland bonnet &#x0026; plaid lying beside him&#x201D;; the boy is &#x201C;lying in the midst of a scene of wild magnificence&#x201D; among &#x201C;woods, hills and waterfalls.&#x201D; 
                    In commissioning verse for this picture, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> asked that <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    connect the image with &#x201C;the glorious romance of your own boyhood when the spirit of poetry &#x0026; romance 
                    first began to pour over you the visions of fairyland.&#x201D; <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> invented a speaker who identifies with the minstrel boy nostalgically, 
                    but distances himself with some disillusionment.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>The affection for youth that <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> expressed in these poems is reflected in his letters to his own children; and during his <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> visit, he cultivated attachments 
                    to the children belonging to several of the families who entertained him, including the Ruskins. His <span class="date-1832-02-09">9 February 1832</span> note to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, 
                    thanking him for his subscription to the deluxe <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span>, closes with &#x201C;kindest love to <span class="persName-MR">Mrs R</span> and dear <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x201D; (indicating that 
                    the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span> must have visited <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> within the first five weeks of his <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> sojourn). In a letter to 
                    <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> written on <span class="date-1833-01-14">14 January 1833</span>, a year after his return to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> sent regards to 
                    &#x201C;Mr Ruskie,&#x201D; declaring &#x201C;that the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">old shepherd</span> shall never 
                    forget their kindness and warmth of attachments to his interests till his dying day,&#x201D; and he entreated &#x201C;to hear from time to time how Mr Ruskie jun. is coming on. 
                    Though I am not very fond in general of precocity of talent I must say yon is the most extraordinary

      </p> 
      
      <p>One year lapsed before <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> followed up on this remembrance with a letter of <span class="date-1834-01-22">22 January 1834</span>,  
                    in which the father evasively explains to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> that <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> had &#x201C;long since . . . favoured&#x201D; 
                    him &#x201C;with a sight of part&#x201D; of the <span class="date-1833-01">January 1833</span> letter commending his son, but that meanwhile 
                    &#x201C;sundry hints from our wife, and niece, and son&#x201D; had been urging reply, since &#x201C;all indulge in periodical remembrances of the delight your only too short visit offered them&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <span class="title-book-GARDENMEMORIALS-italic">Memorials of James Hogg</span></a>, 273&#x2010;74). 
                    What <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> suggests only indirectly is that he was now prompted to confide in <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    concerning <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;precocity of talent,&#x201D; which <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> held in high regard despite his reservations about precocity as such.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>In his letter, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> says that he has ventured to write because <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                    is a man &#x201C;of talent and of heart,&#x201D; whereas &#x201C;the world at large,&#x201D; 
                    lacks &#x201C;comprehen&#x005B;sion&#x005D; . . . patience . . . feeling . . . delicacy,&#x201D; and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> dares not entrust others with his 
                    &#x201C;weaknesses, because&#x201D; he is &#x201C;not yet willing to be laughed out of them.&#x201D; 
                    Namely, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> declares, &#x201C;the youth you were kind enough to notice,&#x201D; his son <span class="persName-JR">John</span>, &#x201C;gives promise of very considerable talent.  
                    His faculty of composition is unbounded.&#x201D; The composition that has finally persuaded <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                    to bring <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s talent to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s attention is  
                    <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>.  
                    &#x201C;Last summer,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> explains, &#x201C;we spent four months in <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> and <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, 
                    of which tour every scene is sketched in verse or prose, or picture&#x201D; in the <span class="title-guidebook-JJRACCOUNT">&#x201C;Account.&#x201D;</span> While he demures over a lack of 
                    &#x201C;any very strong indication of originality&#x201D; in the writing, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> marvels at his son&#x02BC;s &#x201C;rapidity of composition&#x201D; and prolific 
                    production of &#x201C;thosands of lines.&#x201D; <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> included as a sample <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s latest &#x201C;80 or 100 lines&#x201D; (unidentified), 
                    which the boy &#x201C;produced in one hour, while he waited for me in the city&#x201D;

      </p>
      
      <p>Perhaps abashed by <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s expression of distaste for precocity, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                    hastens to assure <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> that he and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> are not &#x201C;fostering a poetical plant or genius&#x201D; in order to be able &#x201C;to say <i>we keep a poet</i>. 
                    It is impossible for any parents to make less of a gift than we do of this, firstly, from its small intrinsic value, as yet unsuspected in him; 
                    and next, because we dread the sacrifice of our offspring by making him a victim to the pangs of despised verse, a sacrifice to a thankless world, 
                    who read, admire, and trample on the greatest and the best&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <span class="title-book-GARDENMEMORIALS-italic">Memorials of James Hogg</span></a>, 274&#x2010;75). 
                    Here <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> appears to evoke the mythology surrounding 
                    <a href="../notes/chatterton_thomas_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-TCPOET">Thomas Chatterton</span> (<span class="date-1752-1770">1752&#x2010;70</span></a>), the perished boy poet. 
                    While suggestive more of rhetorical flourish than of credible anxiety, the allusion links <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span> as an emerging poet to <span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> as an established poet 
                    &#x201C;of talent and of heart,&#x201D; who has nonetheless reaped misfortune and abuse along with his fame. 
                    At the end of his letter, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> commiserates with the poet for having to retreat from the glare of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> with his health compromised, 
                    his life&#x02BC;s work having fallen victim to an insecure publishing scheme. &#x201C;I should like to see your works coming forward in better hands,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> concludes, 
                    referring to the debacle of <span class="orgName-COCHRANE">Cochrane</span>&#x02BC;s bankruptcy. 
                    &#x201C;You began your memoir so well&#x201D; (i.e., the first volume of the <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span>, containing <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-memoir-HOGGMEMOIR">&#x201C;Memoir of the Author&#x02BC;s Life&#x201D;</span>), 
                    &#x201C;that I feel quite enraged at the stupid bookseller for breaking at such a crisis&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <span class="title-book-GARDENMEMORIALS-italic">Memorials of James Hogg</span></a>, 275).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Thus, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s decision to write a year after <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> invited news &#x201C;from time to time &#x005B;of&#x005D; how Mr Ruskie jun. is coming on&#x201D; should perhaps be understood in context of 
                    the Ruskins&#x02BC; wariness of the dangers besetting authorship in the publishing culture of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. As  remarks about <span class="persName-CJHD">Charles Dickens</span>, 
                    who was starting to formulate his persona of &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-CJHD">Boz</span>&#x201D; at this time, considerable entrepreneurial resources were required in order for an author 
                    to &#x201C;both fuel and stand up to capitalist material and cultural production during the heyday of British industrialism&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#PATTENDICKENSANDBOZ" target="_blank" class="inactive">Patten, <span class="title-book-PATTENDICKENSANDBOZ-italic">Charles Dickens and &#x201C;Boz&#x201D;</span></a>, 19). 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s achievement in <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>, 
                    which he was presently composing, and to which his father referred as evidence of serious poetic ability, would shortly lead to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first significant public commission 
                    in the persona of <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>&#x2013;the poem <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">"Saltzburg"</a>, composed to accompany an engraving of that title in the annual, 
                    <span class="title-magazine-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING-italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering . . . for <span class="date-1835">MDCCCXXXV</span></span>, published in <span class="date-1834-11">November 1834</span>. 
                    By the time <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> wrote to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> in <span class="date-1834-01">January 1834</span>, the Ruskins may already have been approached by <span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span>, 
                    as editor of <span class="title-magazine-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING-italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</span>, with the commission for this poem, 
                    and <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> may have looked to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> for guidance as a previous contributor to this annual&#x2013;and yet as one whose deluxe <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span>, 
                    planned on the splendid pattern of the annuals, with the expenses partly underwritten by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> himself, had proved a nonstarter. 
                    It may have been at about this time, too, that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> introduced the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as a prodigy to another great man, 
                    <a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Rogers&#x02BC;s (1763&#x2013;1855</a>), 
                    who by comparison with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> presented an almost opposite example of urbanity and success in the new illustrated literary publishing of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                    but who must also have seemed forbidding as a wealthy and influential &#x201C;man of taste&#x201D; in his London &#x201C;palace of art.&#x201D; 
                    In <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s appeal to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> as a writer &#x201C;of talent and of heart,&#x201D; the father may have sought comfort not only from &#x201C;the world at large,&#x201D; 
                    which lacks &#x201C;comprehen&#x005B;sion&#x005D; . . . patience . . . feeling . . . delicacy,&#x201D; but specifically from the notoriously acid wit of the batchelor poet/banker 
                    of 22 <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span>.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>In a striking contrast with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, who received <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for a stately visit of a few hours to his temple of taste, 
                    with its view of the fashionable metropolitan <span class="placeName-GREENPARK">Green Park</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> invited the boy for an extended stay at his <span class="placeName-ALTRIVE">Altrive</span> farm in <span class="geogName-YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow</span>. The invitation was not unique, 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> having made such an offer also to the young daughter of his publisher, <span class="persName-JCP">James Cochrane</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> loved children and wielded great charm over them, and he appears to have thought of such visits as invigorating holidays for country&#x2010;starved city children 
                    in the company of his own &#x201C;noisy romping healthy brats but good learners&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESHOGGLIFE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hughes <span class="title-biography-HUGHESHOGGLIFE-italic">James Hogg</span></a>, 244, 264). 
                    On <span class="date-1834-02-13">13 February 1834</span>, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> wrote to decline <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s invitation, explaining that he could not &#x201C;make up &#x005B;his&#x005D; mind to leave &#x005B;his&#x005D; parents even for a short time&#x201D; 
                    until he went to university, and that his parents were &#x201C;equally tenacious&#x201D; of him. Writing of what might have been, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> summons an idyllic myth 
                    that frames the nurturing of the emergent writer in a georgic or pastoral setting, like the landscape surrounding <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Minstrel Boy.&#x201D;</span> 
                    Such mythology probably underwrote <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s motives in appealing 
                    to the <span class="persName-pen_name-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span> as a man of &#x201C;heart&#x201D; as well as talent.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Writing nostalgically to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> about &#x201C;the blue hills&#x201D; of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, 
                    among which he has &#x201C;passed some of the happiest days of &#x005B;his&#x005D; short life,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was doubtless thinking 
                    of visits to his father&#x02BC;s family in <a href="../notes/perth_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Perth</a> during the

                    These times in the &#x201C;North Countrie&#x201D; were &#x201C;exceedingly pleasant,&#x201D; but &#x201C;can never more return&#x201D; to him, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mourns; and having framed this ballad&#x2010;like yearning, he goes on to imagine sojourning in the Border country,
