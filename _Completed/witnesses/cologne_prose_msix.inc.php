                    <br/>French bad roads, a long days journey over them,
                    <br/>under a burning sun, together with a peram&#x2010;

      <br/>bulation on a damp evening at <span class="placeName-AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</span>,
                    <br/>so knocked me up, that I was forced to diet
                    <br/>it and quiet it, and could not stir out<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#STIROUTGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span> to see
                    <br/><span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC; last picture, the masterpiece of the mas

                    <br/>him at his death to his native city,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#RUBENSSTPETERGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span> and, yet
                    <br/>more, his birthchamber.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is, in many, in most, of the pictures of <span class="persName-PPR">Ru
                    <br/>bens</span>, and that even in his most sacred subjects
                    <br/>magnificent as they are viewed as paintings
                    <br/>only, an unholiness, a cast of Bacchanaliane
                    <br/>revelry, to say the least, an unpleasingness, that
                    <br/>does him dishonour;<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#DISHONOURGLOSS" target="_blank">4</a></span> But there a few, a cho&#x2010;
                    <br/>sen few, of his pictures, which the master hath
                    <br/>poured his whole soul into, and the produc
                    <br/>tion of one of which, were enough to repay a
                    <br/>lifetime of labour with immortality. There is a
                    <br/>picture, I neither know where it is, nor what
                    <br/>it is, but there is a picture, curtained up in one of
                    <br/>the royal palaces of <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, the <span class="title-artwork-RUBENSSTAMBROSIUS"><span class="persName-STAMBROSE">St Ambrosius</span></span>, I<div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">5</a></span>

      <br/>the rest is in obscurity, there is nothing more, not&#x2010;
                    <br/>hing to disturb either the eye or the mind, and
                    <br/>you feel calmed and subdued when you look u&#x2010;
                    <br/>pon that one solitary figure, as if in the presence
                    <br/>of a superior being. It is impossible to see
                    <br/>that picture, the reality is too striking<span class="g-pause-period">.</span><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_prose_glosses2.php#PAUSEPERIOD" target="_blank">8</a></span> and a
                    <br/>reality so hallowed and so beautiful, that when
                    <br/>the curtain is again drawn over the picture, you
                    <br/>feel as if awaking from a dream of heaven<span class="g-terminal_comma">,</span><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_prose_glosses2.php#TERMINALCOMMA" target="_blank">9</a></span> It
                    <br/>is by such pictures as this that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> has gain&#x2010;
                    <br/>ed his immortality, and it was, I believe such
                    <br/>a picture as this that I did not see at <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>.
                    <br/>Then the disappointment made me worse, and
                    <br/>I could not stir out to see the room in which
                    <br/>he was born. But it don&#x02BC;t signify talking.
                    <br/>Reader, beware of the <span class="placeName-RHEINBERGHOTEL">Grosser Rheinberg hotel</span>
      <br/>at <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. Art thou a poet, a painter, or a
                    <br/>romancer? Imagine the <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, the beauti&#x2010;

                    <br/>will have some idea of the <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, as seen from
                    <br/>the bedroom windows of the <span class="subst-del">g</span><span class="subst-add-overwriting">G</span>rosser Rheinberg<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#GROSSERRHEINBERGGLOSS" target="_blank">13</a></span>
      <br/>Oh, if thou wouldest see the <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span> as it may
                    <br/>be seen, as it ought to be seen, shut your eyes,
                    <br/>sleep your time away, do any thing but look a&#x2010;
                    <br/>bout you, till you get to <span class="placeName-BONN">Bonn</span>, then walk out,
                    <br/>upon the terrace which looks forth over the
                    <br/>swell of the deep waters, to the dim outline of
                    <br/>the <span class="geogName-SIEBENGEBIRGE">seven mountains</span>,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#SEVENMOUNTAINSGLOSS" target="_blank">14</a></span> and there gaze, &#x0026; dream
                    <br/>and meditate, 2ndly. &#x201C;Art thou an epicure?
                    <br/>Imagine mutton chops, which ought to have
                    <br/>been tough, but which age had made ten&#x2010;
                <div id="MSIX34r" class="pb"></div>
      <br/>der, accompanied by circular cakes of congealed
                    <br/>fat, denominated gravy, together with a kind
                    <br/>of brown ashes, apparently moistened, with,
                    <br/>whale oil (which I think they called fried po
                    <br/>tatoes,) as an addition to your feast, and you
                    <br/>have an idea of a dinner of the Grosser Rhein&#x2010;
                    <br/>berg. I have omitted one thing however,<div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">15</a></span>
      <br/>which was really capital, the vinegar. They 
                    <br/>called it Hock wine, certainly, but that don't
                    <br/>signify, you must not be led astray by
                    <br/>names in this part of the world. However,
                    <br/>good vinegar would not make up for the
                    <br/>want or worse than want, of every thing
                    <br/>else, and although the waiters made a
                    <br/>point of not appearing, until the bell had
                    <br/>been rung seven times, we at last made t
