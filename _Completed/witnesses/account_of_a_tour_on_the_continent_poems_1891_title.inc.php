   <p>&#x201C;Early in the spring of <span class="date-1833">1833</span> <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> published his . I well remember going with my father<br/> 
                                into the shop where subscribers entered their names, and being<br/> 
                                referred to the specimen print, the turreted window over the<br/> 
      <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>, at <span class="placeName-COBLENTZ">Coblentz</span>. We got the book home to <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span><br/> 
                                before the time of our usual annual tour; and as my mother<br/>
                                watched my father&#x02BC;s pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful<br/> 
                                places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in<br/> 
                                reality? My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes<br/> 
                                said&#x2014;why not? And there were two or three weeks of entirely<br/> 
                                rapturous and amazed preparation. . . .
   </p>
   
   <p>&#x201C;We went by <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> and <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> to <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>; up the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span><br/> 
                                to <span class="placeName-STRASBURG">Strasburg</span>, across the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span> to <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span>, then made<br/> 
                                a sweep through North <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> by <span class="placeName-BASLE">Basle</span>, <span class="placeName-BERNE">Berne</span>, <span class="placeName-INTERLACHEN">Unterlachen</span>,<br/> 
      <span class="placeName-LUCERNE">Lucerne</span>, <span class="placeName-ZURICH">Zurich</span>, to <span class="placeName-CONSTANCE">Constance</span>,&#x2014;following up the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> still to<br/> 
      <span class="placeName-COIRE">Coire</span>, then over <span class="placeName-SPLUGEN">Spl√ºgen</span> to <span class="placeName-COMO">Como</span>, <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>, and <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span>; meaning,<br/> 
                                as I now remember, for <span class="placeName-ROME">Rome</span>. But, it being <span class="date-1833-06">June</span> already, the<br/> 
                                heat of <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span> warned us of imprudence; we turned, and came<br/> 
                                back over the <span class="placeName-SIMPLON">Simplon</span> to <span class="placeName-GENEVA">Geneva</span>, saw <span class="placeName-CHAMOUNI">Chamouni</span>, and so home<br/> 
                                by <span class="placeName-LYONS">Lyons</span> and <span class="placeName-DIJON">Dijon</span>.&#x201D;
