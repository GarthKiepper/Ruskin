                <p>Tbe traditions of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> have long since been celebrated, and I 
                    hope long will be so, for the terror and amusement, if not the benefit, of 
                    the rising generation. The two districts of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Hartz</geogName><ref type="gloss" target="the_rhine_glosses_contextual.php#HARTZ"/> 
                    have been selected from time immemorial as fitting theatres for the 
                    gambols of brownies, fairies, gnomes, and all other fashionable hobgoblins 
                    of every shape, sort, and size; and the consequence is, that a midnight 
                    walk through the forests of the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Hartz</geogName>, or the vaulted chambers of 
                    <placeName corresp="#RHEINFELS">Rheinfels</placeName>,<ref type="gloss" target="the_rhine_glosses_contextual.php#RHEINFELS"/> would be considered, by many persons possess&#x02BC;d of considerable 
                    strength of nerve in the day&#x2010;time and in places not haunted, as a very 
                    disagreeable, if not positively dangerous affair. Marvel not, therefore, 
                    reader, if I inform you that I considered myself upon suspicious, if not 
                    enchanted, or even haunted ground, as soon as we came in sight of the 
                    crags of <geogName corresp="#DRACHENFELS">Drachenfels</geogName><ref type="gloss" target="the_rhine_glosses_contextual.php#DRACHENFELS"/>, and that my thirst for ancient rhyme or story 
                    became considerably augmented as we advanced farther into that wilderness 
                    of rock and fortress, which must be traversed by the voyageur who 
                    passes between <placeName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#STGOAR">St. Goar</placeName>. I could not hope for much 
                    true dictionary<ref type="gloss_textual" target="the_rhine_prose_glosses_textual.php#TRADITIONARY" /> lore from most of the personages whom we encountered 
                    on any of our perambulations, judging from their countenances, at least. 
                    I do not, at present, remember any physiognomies which exhibit so much 
                    of, let me see, a combination of the stupidity, lifelessness, and laziness of 
                    the owl, with the ugliness of the monkey, as do those of the generality of 
                    the German peasantry and lower classes;<ref type="gloss" target="ehrenbreitstein_glosses_contextual.php#GERMANBRAINS"/> and I was therefore not particularly 
                    tempted to interrogate any of them upon the subject before alluded 
                    to, until at length Fortune threw an individual in my way who appeared 
                    likely to be able to answer any inquiries which I might make, entirely to 
                    my own satisfaction.<ref type="gloss" target="the_rhine_glosses_contextual.php#FORTUNE"/></p>
