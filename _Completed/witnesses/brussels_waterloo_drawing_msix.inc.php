   Pen and ink, approx. ? &#x00D7; ? cm (image only). The editors of the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> 
                        describe the image as &#x201C;a sketch of the field of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span>; soldiers with cannon in the foreground; a general on his horse&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:347 n. 1). 
                        While <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> certainly intends the drawing to depict a scene from the <span class="date-1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</span>, 
                        which is mentioned in &#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;&#x2014;both in the prose section surrounding 
                        the drawing, and in the poem preceding the prose section&#x2014;he based his drawing <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignette, 
                        <span class="title-artwork-TURNERMARENGO">&#x201C;Marengo&#x201D;</span>, 
                        depicting the <span class="date-1800-06-14">Battle of Marengo</span>, which was engraved for and published in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#ROGERSITALY1830" target="_blank" class="inactive">Samuel Rogers, <i>Italy</i> (1830)</a> (p. 17; and 
                        see no. 6 of catalog in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Piggott, <i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></a>, 98). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits the left side of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s original drawing, 
                        copying only the general on his rearing horse and the group gathered around the cannon on the right. 
                        In order to resituate the scene in <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also omits 
                        the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> that <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> shows in the north above the <span class="placeName-PIEDMONT">Piedmont</span> plain; 
                        instead, he places a town in the distance, probably intended as <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, shown with its two large cathedral towers in silouette. 
                        By adapting <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s scene to <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intensifies <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s irony. The <span class="date-1800-06-14">Battle of Marengo</span> 
                        was a decisive victory for <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> in his second Italian campaign against the Austrians, 
                        allegedly causing the British prime minister, <span class="persName-WPY">William Pitt</span> (<span class="date-1759-1806">1759&#x2013;1806</span>), 
                        to declare with resignation, &#x201C;Fold up that map,&#x201D; meaning that the French general had effectively conquered all of Europe 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Piggott, <i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></a>, 38). 
                        <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> undermines this victory by placing this vignette above <span class="persName-SR"></span>Rogers&#x02BC;s poem, 
                        &#x201C;The Descent,†áç referring literally to the descent from the mountains into <span class="placeName-PIEDMONT">Piedmont</span>, 
                        but gesturing figuratively at <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>&#x02BC;s eventual fall. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> completes <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s ironic narrative by bringing the image forward in time 
                        to <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span>; and he may have meant the viewer to displace <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span> as the equestrian figure 
                        (which <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> based on the portrait by <span class="persName-JLD">Jacques&#x2013;Louis David</span> &#x005B;<span class="date-1748-1825">1748&#x2013;1825</span>&#x005D;, 
                        <span class="title-artwork-DAVIDNAPOLEONCROSSINGALPS"><i>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</i></span> &#x005B;<span class="date-1802-1805">1802&#x2013;5</span>&#x005D;) 
                        and to put the victorious <span class="persName-AWW">Wellington</span> in the saddle, since the figure appears to wear his bicorne with the points &#x201C;fore and aft&#x201D; rather than side to side, 
                        parallel with the shoulders, in <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>&#x02BC;s signature manner.
