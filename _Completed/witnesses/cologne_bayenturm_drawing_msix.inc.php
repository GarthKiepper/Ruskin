   Pen and ink, approx. ? &#x00D7; ? cm (image only). The editors of the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> 
                        describe the image as a &#x201C;a sketch of <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>: the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, bridge, 
                        and unfinished cathedral in the distance; in the foreground to the left, tower and shipping&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:351 n. 3). The drawing is a copy of 
                        <span class="title-artwork-PROUTCOLOGNE">&#x201C;Cologne</span>, by 
                        <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span> (<span class="date-1783-1852">1783&#x2013;1852</span>)</a>, 
                        in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#PROUTSKETCHES" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</i></span></a> 
                        (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>). The lithograph depicts a river scene dominated by the thirteenthȐcentury <span class="placeName-building-BAYENTURM">Bayenturm</span>, 
                        the southern watch tower and city gate of the medieval city wall. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omits the foreground figures sitting on the wharf in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s lithograph, 
                        and he eliminates much of the wharf itself that strongly defines the horizontal axis of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s foreground. 
                        At the same time, he brings closer the distant buildings in the north along the river, rendering <span class="placeName-building-STPETERCATHEDRAL">Cologne Cathedral</span> more distinct. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> sketches the medieval crane that stood atop the southern tower of the cathedral for centuries. The silhouette of the cathedral shows the phase 
                        in which construction was suspended from the fourteenth through the midȐnineteenth centuries, from the completion of the Gothic choir in <span class="date-1322">1322</span> to the resumption 
                        of construction of the south towers in <span class="date-1842-1880">1842&#x2013;80</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also picks up from <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> 
                        the old bridge of boats extending horizontally across the river from the vicinity of the cathedral, defining the north horizon of the picture.
