   <p>How lightly the waves of the broad <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>
      <br/>crisped with the first breath of the mor&#x2010;
                <br/>ning as we swept over the long bridge
                <br/>that crosses the river from <span class="placeName-NAMUR">Namur</span>, and
                <br/>looked back on the rich dome of its small<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">1</a></span>
      <br/>but beautiful cathedral,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#LONGBRIDGEGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span> as it began to
                <br/>smile to the first glance of the joyous
                <br/>sun that was drinking up the delicate
            <div id="MSIX27r" class="pb"></div>
      <br/>mists which clung to the hills, and rested on
                <br/>the valley, in which the fair city reposed<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">3</a></span>
      <br/>so peacefully &#x2014; and then we dashed along
                <br/>the valley of the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>. I know not, if it<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">4</a></span>
      <br/>was because this was our first initiation in
                <br/>to<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#INTO" target="_blank">5</a></span> the scenery of continental rivers, but this<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">6</a></span>
      <br/>part of the <span class="placeName-MEUSE">Meuse</span> appeared to me infinitely
                <br/>preferable (not in point of sublimity or
                <br/>beauty,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#BEAUTY" target="_blank">7</a></span> but in that romantic and pi
                <br/>cturesque fairy beauty which is, in many
                <br/>cases, superior to either), to any thing which
                <br/>I ever afterwards saw on the shores of the
                <br/>far famed <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine.</span> There was, to me, a
                <br/>great sameness throughout the whole of<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">8</a></span>
      <br/>the course of the latter river, and, for its<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">9</a></span>
      <br/>fortresses, it is positively too much of a good
                <br/>thing, a tiresome repetition of ruins, and
                <br/>ruins too, which do not altogether agree<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">10</a></span>
      <br/>with my idea of what ruins ought to be.
                <br/>But for the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>, the infinite variety of scene&#x2013;
                <br/>ry.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#PAUSEPERIOD" target="_blank">11</a></span> the impossibility of seeing every successive

      <br/>change as you feel that it ought to be seen &#x2014;, and,
                <br/>finally, the tantalizing rate at which you dash<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">12</a></span>
      <br/>away from that which you could feast upon, and<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">13</a></span>
      <br/>look upon, and dwell upon, for &#x2014; ages I was going
                <br/>to say, months, I will say, are enough to enchant
                <br/>you with anything. If you wish to see rock scen&#x2010;
                <br/>ery in perfection, go to the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#GOTOTHEMEUSEGLOSS" target="_blank">14</a></span> for never were<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">15</a></span>
      <br/>rocks more beautifully disposed, more richly and<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">16</a></span>
      <br/>delicately wooded, or more finely contrasted with<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">17</a></span>
      <br/>the amazing richness of the surrounding scenery.
                <br/>But alas, it was but a forenoon ride, and the eve

      <br/>for the smoky streets and coal wharfs of <span class="placeName-LIEGE">Liege</span>,
