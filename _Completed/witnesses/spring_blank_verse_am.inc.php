   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">What beauties spring thou hast the waving lilac</span><br/>
      <span class="l">and the stiff tall peach with roselike flowers</span><br/>
      <span class="l">with yellow chorchorus and with nectarine blossom</span><br/>
      <span class="l">some with grace wave and some though tall are stiff</span><br/>
      <span class="l">waving is lilac, so is yellow chorchorus</span><br/>
      <span class="l">waving is cherry blossom though not so graceful</span><br/>
      <span class="l">as the spiry lilac and the hyacinth</span><br/>
      <span class="l">stiff is the pear and nectarine with the peach</span><br/>
      </span>
   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">and apricot, all these are stiff but in return</span><br/>
      <span class="l">their flowers are beautiful. so are birds and beasts</span><br/>
      <span class="l">as well as flowers some are wild and cruel</span><br/>
      <span class="l">such are the tiger, panther, lynx and ounce</span><br/>
      </span>
   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">so also in return these animals</span><br/>
      <span class="l">are pretty in the other sort</span><br/>
      <span class="l">some dogs are ugly, but conceal within</span><br/>
      <span class="l">some good intentions good ideas good thoughts.</span><br/>
      </span>
   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">but spring, there is one tree that thou bring&#x02BC;st forth</span><br/>
      <span class="l">that is more beautiful than all the others&#x2014;</span><br/>
      <span class="l">this is the apple blossom o how sweet</span><br/>
      <span class="l">is that fine tree and so I end.</span><br/>
      </span>
