                    <br/>ified, which thou wilt not approve of.&#x2014;. Thou
                    <br/>shalt find a treaty whereof the first condition
                    <br/>is, that the postillions whip be not closely ac&#x2010;

      <br/>rate than two miles an hour.
   </p>
   
   <p>Item, that the above mentioned quadrupeds, be
                    <br/>not compelled to trot upon the paved centre of the
                    <br/>road, but that they be permitted to draw the car&#x2010;
                    <br/>riage, chariot, gig, or other vehicle, into the beds of
                    <br/>sand and dust, denominated by the postillion,

                    <br/>ing overset into the ditch, which commonly bor&#x2010;
                    <br/>dereth upon the road.</p>
   
   <p>Item, that the postillion be permitted, when

      <br/>upon the back of his horse, to indulge himself with<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/aix_la_chapelle_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">5</a></span>
      <br/>a comfortable pipe, and half hours nap, or so, dur&#x2010;
                    <br/>ring which time his above mentioned quadrup&#x2010;
                    <br/>eds, be surrendered to their own will, guidance,
                    <br/>and management.
   </p>
   
   <p>Alas, every article of this treaty was strictly ful&#x2010;
                    <br/>filled with regard to us, and the consequence was,
                    <br/>that in a six hours ride of twelve miles, I was<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/aix_la_chapelle_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">6</a></span>
      <br/>first fevered by the sun, then smothered by the
                    <br/>dust, and finally was,&#x2014; but let that pass
                    <br/>for the present.

      <br/>streams of coloured and variegated light, fal&#x2010;
                    <br/>ling faintly through the Gothic windows,
                    <br/>streaming at intervals along the chequered
                    <br/>floors or ruddily lighting up the countenan&#x2010;
                    <br/>ces, of the marble figures, giving a ghastly re
