   <span class="lg-stanza">
      <span class="l">The sky was clear, the morn was gay</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In promise of a cloudless day</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Fresh flew the breeze, with whose light wing</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Aspen and oak were quivering</span><br/>
      <span class="l">From flow&#x02BC;ret dank it dashed the dew</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The harebell bent its blossom blue,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And from the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span> the mistwreaths<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#MISTWREATHSGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span> grey</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That morning breeze had swept away</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Showing such scenes as well might seem</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The fairy vision of a dream<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#FAIRYVISIONGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">For changing still, and still as fair</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rock, wave, and wood were mingled there</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Peak over peak, fantastic ever</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX26r" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">The lofty crags deep chasms sever.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And grey and gaunt their lichened head</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rose sheerly from the rivers bed<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#PEAKOVERPEAKGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">Whose mantling wave in foamy sheet</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Their stern projecting bases beat,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And lashed to fury in his pride</span><br/>
      <span class="l">In circling whirlpools swept the tide</span><br/>
      <span class="l">As threatening, on some future day</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Those mighty rock<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_poem_glosses2.php#ROCKGLOSS" target="_blank">4</a></span> to tear away</span><br/>
      <span class="l">What though their front should seem to be</span><br/>
      <span class="l">A barrier, to eternity<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_meuse_glosses.php#BARRIERGLOSS" target="_blank">5</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">And on its side the cliffs between </span><br/>
      <span class="l">Were mazy forests ever seen</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That the tall cliffs steep flanks so grey</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Were clothed in mantle green and gay</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Long time along that dell so deep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Beside the rivers bed we sweep</span><br/>
      <span class="l">So steep the mighty crests inclined</span><br/>
      <span class="l">None other pathway you might find</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Till the tall cliffs gigantic grace</span><br/>
      <span class="l">To undulating hills gave place</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX26v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">And vineyards clothe the bending brow</span><br/>
      <span class="l">&#x02BC;Stead of the clinging copsewood now</span><br/>
      </span>
