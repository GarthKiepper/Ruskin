      <span class="l">a figure es it is for on the tops of shops</span><br/>
      <span class="l">we often see a figure with two wings</span><br/>
      <span class="l">a scythe upon one shoulder and a lock</span><br/>
      <span class="l">of hair upon his forehead while his head is bald</span><br/>
      <span class="l">except the lock upon his forehead and called time</span><br/>
      <span class="l">times very quick and therefore he has wings</span><br/>
      <span class="l">when past times gone for ever so he has a lock</span><br/>
      <span class="l">of hair upon his forehead and the proverb is</span><br/>
      <span class="l">take time by his forelock. he mows down every thing</span><br/>
      <span class="l">and so he has a scythe. time is so quick</span><br/>
      <span class="l">that might a year be called a day</span><br/>
      <span class="l">ay now I think of it tis <span class="date-1827-01-01">ew&#x2010;ears&#x2010;ay</span></span><br/>

      <span class="l">as time does time I&#x02BC;m quite away from him</span><br/>
      <span class="l">away from him no surely I&#x02BC;m not so</span><br/>
      <span class="l">for I&#x02BC;m at heathen gods and he&#x02BC;s a god</span><br/>
      <span class="l">so though I may be from him I&#x02BC;m not far</span><br/>
      <span class="l">from him. and now I must go to him quite</span><br/>
