   <p>&#x2014;How much has been said of <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>. Every one who
                    <br/>has ever set his foot on the French shore, from poor
                    <br/><span class="name--YORICK">Yorick</span> to the veriest scribbler ever blotted paper, has
                    <br/>written half a volume upon <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>. And no marvel.<div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/calais_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">1</a></span>

   <p>See <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, and you can see no more, though you

   <p>Stand on the pier and look round you The sky is a 
                            <br/>French sky, it is a very turquoise, the sea is a <div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/calais_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">8</a></span>
      <br/>French sea in every thing but its want of motion
                            <br/>the air is French air, none of your English bois&#x2010;
                            <br/>terous sea puffs that blow the dust in your eyes
                            <br/>when you wish to be particularly clear sighted.
                            <br/>No, it is a mere breath, you can&#x02BC;t call it a breeze
                            <br/>yet bearing a delicious, a balmy coolness, and a<div class="g-justification" style="width:NaNem"> </div><span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/calais_prose_glosses2.php#JUSTIFICATION" target="_blank">9</a></span>
      <br/>little, a very little smell of the sea. Look at the
                            <br/>fishing boats, they are peculiarly French, and
                            <br/>particularly clumsy. The red tattered shapeless
                            <br/>sail the undistinguishable resemblance of stem 
                            <br/>to stern, the porpoise like manner in which the
                            <br/>vessel labours through the water, the incorrigible
                            <br/>disorder that reigns on board, the confusion of
                            <br/>fish out of water with men, &#x2014; that are at least
                            <br/>out of their element, would mark a french fish&#x2010;
                            <br/>ing boat, whatever quarter of the world it 
                            <br/>might happen to be driven to.

   <p>And look at the town, the chimnies are entire&#x2010;
                            <br/>ly vapourless, and have that peculiarly awk&#x2010;

      <br/>ward look incident to all useless things. And
                            <br/>look at the people, the countenance, the costume
                            <br/>the tout ensemble is altogether different from
                            <br/>any thing you ever saw in England, and
                            <br/>yet Englands cliffs are on the horizon, half an
                            <br/>hours might see you beneath them,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/calais_glosses.php#FOURHOURSGLOSS" target="_blank">10</a></span> &#x2014; It is 
                            <br/>most extraordinary. &#x2014;
