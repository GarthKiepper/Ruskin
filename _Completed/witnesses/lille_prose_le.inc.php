   <p><i>Passeport, monsieur, s&#x02BC;il vous plait</i>. I hate fortified towns, in general, 
                    that is.&#x2014;Their houses are like barracks, their public buildings like prisons, 
                    their population like so many rats in a rat trap; they are arduous to get 
                    in,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_prose_glosses2.php#GET_IN" target="_blank">1</a></span> difficult to get out, and disagreeable to remain in. To all this, 
                    however, <span class="placeName-LILLE">Lille</span> is an exception, except in one circumstance&#x2014;its difficulty of access. 
                    We were detained after a long day&#x02BC;s journey under a burning sun, hot, 
                    hungry, and stupid, while our passport was examined. Slowly the sentinel 
                    unfolded the paper, spelled over its contents with tiresome coolness and 
                    provoking minuteness, slowly returned it, and then came&#x2014;<i>Passez</i>.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_glosses.php#PASSPORT" target="_blank">2</a></span> And 
                    pass we did right gladly. <span class="placeName-LILLE">Lille</span> is a beautiful, a most beautiful town. I 
                    have seen none equal to it, for grandeur of effect, for the massive 
                    magnificence of its edifices, for the palace like nobility of its streets, except 
                    <span class="placeName-GENOA">Genoa</span>. The day also on which we entered it was almost Italian, the sky 
                    was of such a deep and unbroken blue, and a stream of rich, glowing, 
                    tawny light shot upon the full fretwork and elaborate carving of the upper 
                    parts of the houses; but their bases, owing to the narrowness of the 
                    streets and the enormous height of the opposing buildings, were wrapt in 
                    shade, deep, gloomily deep, when contrasted with the flood of sunshine 
                    that glanced on the gable roofs, and almost gave to life<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_prose_glosses2.php#GAVETOLIFE" target="_blank">3</a></span> the many statues 
                    of the <span class="persName-VIRGINMARY">Virgin</span>, that stood beneath their Gothic niches, really very 
                    respectably sculptured, at every angle of the streets.<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/lille_glosses.php#SHADE" target="_blank">4</a></span></p>
