   Pen and ink, approx. ? &#x00D7; ? cm (image only). The editors of the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> 
                        describe the image as &#x201C;to left, a group of large trees; to right, a wayside shrine; between these a river with a town in the fair distance&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:347 n. 1). 
                        The curved expanse between the trees and the shrine may be intended for a road, not a river, as there appear to ruts running in its center.  
                        A worshiper kneels in front of the shrine and lifts clasped hands; a pair of figures lounges beneath the trees.
