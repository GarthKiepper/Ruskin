      <span class="l">The noon was past, the sun was low</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Yet still we felt his arid glow</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX31v" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">From the red sand reflected glare</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Deadened the breeze, and fired the air</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The open sky was misty grey,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The clouds in mighty masses lay</span><br/>
      <span class="l">That heaped on the horizon high,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Marked Alpine outline on the sky</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Long had we toiled to gain a brow,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#GAINABROWGLOSS" target="_blank">1</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">On which we stood triumphant now<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_poem_glosses2.php#ERASEDLINESGLOSS" target="_blank">2</a></span></span><br/>

      <span class="l">While the white mist was certain sign</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Where took his course the mighty <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span>,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Hills in the distant haze were seen,<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/cologne_glosses.php#SIEBENGEBIRGEGLOSS" target="_blank">3</a></span></span><br/>
      <span class="l">And wide expanse of plain between,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Whose desert length without a tree,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Was stretched in vast monotony.</span><br/>
      <span class="l">We drove adown that hill amain</span><br/>
      <span class="l">We past along the shadeless plain</span><br/>
      <span class="l">Rested we now where uncontrolled</span><br/>
      <span class="l">The <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span> his bursting billows rolled,</span><br/>
      <span class="l">And ever, ever, fierce and free,</span><br/>
      <div id="MSIX32r" class="pb"></div>
      <span class="l">Bore broadly onward to the sea.</span><br/>
