         <p>The <i>Early Ruskin Manuscripts, 1826&#x2013;1842</i> is a project of Southeastern Louisiana University
                            and Humanities Online, both under the direction of the university's Department of English.
         </p>
         
         <p>All commentary in <i>ERM</i>, including apparatuses, glosses, notes transcripts, and other editorial
                            treatments of the manuscripts is &#x00A9; by David C. Hanson. If quoting from <i>ERM</i>, please
                            identify the title of the work or commentary quoted, the date that you accessed <i>ERM</i>, and the
                            following credit line and url: <i>The Early Ruskin Manuscripts, 1826&#x2013;1842</i>. Ed. David C.

         <p>The early Ruskin manuscripts are divided among several archives. For any given work or manuscript, permission for a
                            facsimile and transcript is credited to the relevant archive in the Apparatus Pages for both works and manuscripts, in
                            the section of a given apparatus describing &#x201C;Manuscripts.&#x201D;</p>
         
         <p>In notes and apparatuses throughout <i>ERM</i>, unpublished manuscripts relating to the Ruskin family are
                            occasionally quoted to illuminate the context of the early Ruskin manuscripts forming the archive. Much of this material
                            was researched by the editor at the Ruskin Library, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK. Quotations in each case are
                            identified via links to the <i>ERM</i> Bibliography. The Ruskin Library has supplied the following
                            statement concerning copyright of the manuscript collection held by the Ruskin Library: The Ruskin Foundation, which has
                            care of these materials, has sought to establish the copyright for John Ruskin&#x02BC;s unpublished literary manuscripts,
                            but has been unable to do so on the basis of all the information currently known to it. It would therefore welcome
                            contact from any person or persons who can show they hold this copyright.
