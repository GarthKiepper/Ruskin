                    Ruskin family approached the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> 
                    for the first time from the north, traveling from <span class="placeName-SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</span> and <span class="placeName-CONSTANCE">Constance</span>, 
                    and they crossed into <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> through the <span class="geogName-VIAMALA">Via Mala</span> and the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Spl√ºgen Pass</span> 
                    (see <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1833</a>).<br/>

         <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> models this arrangement on <i>Italy</i> by <a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Rogers (<span class="date-1763-1855">1763&#x2013;1855</span>)</a>, 
                    in which a poem about the western Alpine pass, &#x201C;The Great St. Bernard,&#x201D; gives way to &#x201C;The Descent,&#x201D; 
                    followed by &#x201C;The Alps.&#x201D; In the latter poem, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s speaker retraces imaginatively the entire span of the crossing, 
                    preparing for his celebration of arrival in the following poems about <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                    (Also, between &#x201C;The Descent&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Alps,&#x201D; <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> pauses to relate two verse tales: &#x201C;Jorasse,&#x201D; 
                    a highland tale about an intrepid Alpine hunter; and &#x201C;Marguerite de Tours,&#x201D; a lowland tale about a girl who crosses from <span class="placeName-">Martigny</span>, 
                    on the Swiss side of the <span class="geogName-STBERNARD">St. Bernard</span>, to the opposite <span class="placeName-VALDAOSTA">vale of Aosta</span> in order to attend to her dying father. 
                    In the <span class="date-1839">1839</span> edition, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> added a third tale, &#x201C;The Brothers,&#x201D; about twin brothers who lose their infant brother to an eagle.)<br/>
                    
                    In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">plan</a> for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                    he makes <a href="../witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> serve the structural function of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; as a summary reflection on the experience of crossing. Both poems use a trope of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> as a &#x201C;barrier&#x201D; between civilizations, 
                    a trope developed by a historical reference to <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span> as the sublime analogy for struggling against that barrier 
                    (<span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s crossing is also the subject of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignette for &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; 
                    in the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated <i>Italy</i>). Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> captures <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    idea of one poem serving as an epitome of the experience of crossing that is elaborated&#x2014;topographically, historically, anecdotally&#x2014;in surrounding poems.<br/>
                    
                    There are also differences between <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    and <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s crossing poems. In <a href="../witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                    develops the vision of <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s invasion as its sole topic, 
                    whereas in &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> characteristically contrasts the turbulent past with his speaker&#x02BC;s present 
                    &#x201C;path of pleasure&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1830" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> &#x005B;1830&#x005D;</a>, 30). 
                    Also, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, according to his <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">plan</a>, 
                    intended to situate <a href="../witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> 
                    at the head of a cluster of poems about the mountain pass, unlike <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> who posed &#x201C;The Alps&#x201D; as a retrospection past the watershed. 
                    Despite these differences, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> clearly adopted structural cues from <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s sequence of poems.<br/>
                    
                    According to this interpretation, <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> violated <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s structural intentions. 
                    As the first editor to reconstruct the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; by appending draft to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> erred 
                    by placing &#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D; between <a href="../witnesses/genoa_poem_1891.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Genoa&#x201D;</a> 
                    and <a href="../witnesses/chamouni_poem_msvii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Chamouni&#x201D;</a>, causing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem 
                    to function as a transition between <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> and <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span>, 
                    rather than between <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> and <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. The latter arrangement appears to have been in 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mind as early as the <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a> sequence, 
                    which pairs <a href="../witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> with 
                    <a href="../witnesses/milan_cathedral_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</a>.<br/>
                    
                    In another view, however, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s erroneous placement of &#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D; was inspired, 
                    for while he disrupted <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s elaboration of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s model, 
                    the editor used available materials to patch together an approximation of how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cluster of poems 
                    about the north crossing would eventually have been mirrored by a cluster about the western crossing. According to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">plan</a>, the <span class="geogName-SPLUGEN">Spl√ºgen</span> cluster, extending from 
                    <a href="../witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> through 
                    <a href="../witnesses/the_descent_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;The Descent&#x201D;</a> and poems on the Italian lakes, 
                    would have been mirrored in reverse by a cluster including &#x201C;The Ascent&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Grand St. Bernard,&#x201D; leading to &#x201C;The Lake of Geneva&#x201D;&#x2014;and 
                    doubtless this cluster, too, would have exploited <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s tropes about crossings. Thus, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    solution reveals another way in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> abandoned &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; only when he had effectively completed his apprenticeship to his models 
                    (see <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent.php#SOURCES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Discussion&#x2014;Sources</a>). 
                    Moreover, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;misplacement&#x201D; allows <a href="../witnesses/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> 
                    to stand in for &#x201C;The Grand St. Bernard,&#x201D; which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> never composed, by associating the reference to 
                    <span class="persName-HANNIBAL">Hannibal</span>&#x02BC;s crossing with a western passage where the event belongs historically.</span><br><br>
