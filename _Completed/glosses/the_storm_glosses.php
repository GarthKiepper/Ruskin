      <span id="STORMCROSS">Line 4&#x2014;The meaning and origin of the cross above &#x201C;pigs&#x201D; in line 4 are unknown. Evidently, the mark is a comment on the poem by somebody, 
                    rather than a part of the poem itself. See <a href="../notes/editorial_rationale_note.php#METAMARKS" target="_blank">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology: Metamarks</a>.</span><br><br>
      
      <span id="BAD">&#x201C;Bad&#x201D; (<span class="title-poem-MSIII">MS III</span>)&#x2014;Although on the same line as the runover of line 10, 
                    the word clearly is not meant to form part of that runover, as in that case it would intervene between the two syllables of the word, 
                    <i>lightnings</i>, which is divided by the runover. Rather, the term, which appears in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>â‚¼s hand, 
                    functions as a metamark&#x2014;not as part of the poem, but as a comment on it.</span><br><br>
