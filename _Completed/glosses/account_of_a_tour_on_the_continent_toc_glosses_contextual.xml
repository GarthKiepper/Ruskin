                    The city was important as a banking and mercantile center, with a large Jewish population
                    including such prosperous families as the <orgName corresp="#ROTHSCHILD">Rothschilds</orgName>. Ministers from <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</placeName> were stationed here; accordingly, in his guidebook,

                    In <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName>, the family stayed in the <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOTELDERUSSIE">Hotel de Russie</placeName>, erected by a gentleman of property for his own use, according to <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>,

                    <p>On Monday, <persName corresp="#KOCH">Mr. Koch</persName> drove the Ruskins to a cemetery, doubtless the <placeName type="building" corresp="#FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery (Neue Friedhof)</placeName> beyond the city walls,
                        which <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName> recommended for its &#x201C;charming view of <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfort</placeName>, and the <geogName corresp="#TAUNUSR">Taunus [River]</geogName>&#x201D;.
                        Opened in <date when="1828">1828</date> along with the adjacent Jewish cemetery, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#FRANKFURTNEWCEMETERY">New Cemetery</placeName> presented an example of the public cemetery that was starting to replace church and churchyard burial,
                        an antiquated custom that &#x201C;deserve[d] to be abolished&#x201D; in the view of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="loudon_j_c_note.php"><persName corresp="#JCL">John Claudius Loudon</persName></ref>,
                        especially in &#x201C;large and densely inhabited cities&#x201D;. The most famous example of the new trend was the 
                        <placeName type="building" corresp="#PERELACHAISE">Cimeti&#x00E8;re du P&#x00E8;re&#x2010;Lachaise</placeName>, which the Ruskins visited toward the end of their tour. 
                        Visiting the <placeName corresp="FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName> cemetery in about the same year as did the Ruskins, the English artist
                        <persName corresp="#JML">James Mathews Leigh</persName> (<date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1860">1808&#x2013;60</date>) noted, like <persName corresp="#JCL">Loudon</persName>, the neoclassicism of the architecture,
                        while also enjoying propects influenced by the picturesque tradition.
                        The structures were designed by the neoclassical architect, <persName corresp="#FRUMPF">Friedrich Rumpf</persName> (<date notBefore="1795" notAfter="1867">1795&#x2013;1867</date>),
                        and the grounds were laid out in English garden style by <persName corresp="#SRINZ">Sebastian Rinz</persName> (<date notBefore="1782" notAfter="1861">1782&#x2013;1861</date>).
                        A Doric propylaeum formed the entrance, which doubled as apartments for burial preparations &#x201C;undertaken by a Company at small cost&#x201D;, indicating the new commercial cemetery operations
                        that were displacing parish church control; and the burial plots were housed both in a necropolis&#x2010;style &#x201C;simple colonnade . . . divided into fifty&#x2010;five compartments&#x201D;,
                        &#x201C;each . . . devoted to a family vault&#x201D;, and in the grander, &#x201C;handsome mausoleum[s]&#x201D; that stood apart. <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, with her usual British pride,
                        considered the <placeName corresp="#FRANKFURT">Frankfurt</placeName> cemetery inferior to one in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName>,
                        likely referring to <placeName type="building" corresp="#STJAMESSCEMETERY">St. James&#x02BC;s Cemetery</placeName>, opened in <date when="1829">1829</date> as a pioneering British alternative to overcrowded urban churchyards.
                        Designed by <persName corresp="#JFOSTERA">John Foster</persName> (<date notBefore="1787" notAfter="1846">1787&#x2013;1846</date>), this site likewise featured severe neoclassicism in the form of a Doric temple,
                        the <placeName type="building" corresp="#LIVERPOOLORATORY">Oratory</placeName>. Thus, contemporary cemetery architecture and sepulchral monuments presented <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>
                        with one notable experience of modern neoclassicism; see also

                    Since <persName corresp="#MDESAXE">Maurice de Saxe</persName> remained a Lutheran throughout his life, the commission of his elaborate tomb by the French crown

                    <persName corresp="#JGE">J. G.

                    but it is now very much decayed, notwithstanding the efforts which <persName corresp="#NBE">Buonaparte</persName> made to re-establish it.
                    The town is badly built, the houses filthy, and many of them uninhabited&#x201D;. As principal tourist sites,

                    they are conducted to the bathing house by an aqueduct, raised about 200 feet above the river&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 39;

                    She then describes their intrepid descent into the gorge, again borrowing on the following account in <persName corresp="#JGE">Ebel</persName>:</p>
                    <floatingText>
                        <body>
                            <div>
                                <p>The most lively imagination could not describe the entrance of <placeName corresp="#TARTARUS">Tartarus</placeName>, under so hideous a form as that which nature has displayed in framing the defile of the <geogName corresp="#TAMINAG">Tamina</geogName>.
                                    You enter it over a bridge composed of planks that rest on wedges beat into the rocks. This bridge is 6 or 700 paces long, which requires above a quarter of an hour
                                    to get over, as you must proceed with great caution. It is suspended over the <geogName corresp="#TAMINAG">Tamina</geogName>, which is heard to roll furiously beneath it thirty or forty feet deep.
                                    Near to the bridge the defile is thirty feet wide, but lower down it straitens as it descends along the torrent. The lateral walls, cleft and torn in divers ways,
                                    rise 200 feet high, bend towards each other in the shape of a dome, and are 290 feet in height at that part where they entirely join. The faint light which illumines
                                    the entrance of the defile disappears in proportion as you proceed; and the damp cold that prevails increases the horror of the place. Sometimes the rocks
                                    that overhang the bridge are so close, that they will not allow one to stand up; and at another time they are so distant from it, that they no longer serve as a support.
                                    The bridge is narrow, often very slippery, and it will sometimes occur that one single plank stands between the traveller and the dark abyss of the <geogName corresp="#TAMINAG">Tamina</geogName>. . . .
                                    The best method of avoiding danger is to walk between two men, each of them holding the extremities of a pole on the side of the precipice, which will serve as a support
                                    and a railing to the tourist. The spring is situated beyond the bridge. . . . I shall invite all such people, who are unwilling to expose themselves to the danger
                                    of going as far as the spring, to advance at least fifty paces on the bridge, beyond the entrance of the defile, and to sit down there to view at leisure the terrific prospect
                                    of that dreadful passage.</p>

                    responded enthusiastically to the Gothic cathedral, a preference that led early in the development of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNT">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s only completed poem about <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>,

                    In that poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> emphasizes the vertical thrust of the carthedral, comparing its spires to <geogName corresp="#MONTEROSA">Monte Rosa</geogName> rising on the city&#x02BC;s horizon,

                    Nonetheless, the Ruskins did seek out monuments in <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> that attested to <persName corresp="NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s thwarted plans

                        which spans the rapid river with one bold arch, 70 ft. wide, leaning for support (appuy&#x00E9;) on the rt. side upon the <geogName corresp="#DENTDEMORCLES">Dent de Morcles</geogName>

                        whose bases are pushed so far forward as barely to leave room for the river. The <placeName corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge</placeName>, erroneously attributed to the Romans,
                        is not older than the <date notBefore="1400" notAfter="1499">15th century</date>, but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">canton Vaud</placeName>
                        with the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">canton Vallais</placeName>; and a gate at one end, now removed, formerly served to close the passage up and down:
                        a circumstance alluded to in the lines of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>. A small fort was erected by the Swiss in <date when="1832">1832</date>, above the road,

                        emphasizes an invidious distinction typically made by British Victorian tourists between Protestant and Catholic Swiss cantons:

                        Their physical condition is lamentable; no part of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> is afflicted to a greater extent with the maladies of go&#x00EE;tre and cretinism . . . ,
                        and the victims of them shock the traveller&#x02BC;s sight at every step&#x201D;
