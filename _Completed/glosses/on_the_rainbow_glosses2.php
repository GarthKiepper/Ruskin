                    he presumably does not intend the punctuation closing line 5 as a pause&#x2010;period but as a terminal period, despite the lack of an independent clause in lines 2&#x2013;4;

      <span id="LINE14ADDITION">Line 14&#x2014;While the word <i>all</i> has the appearance of a runover, it is positioned very close above line 14, and written unusually small; 
                    and since the word makes clearer semantic sense as part of the prepositional phrase in line 14 than as part of the prepositional phrase in line 13, 
                    we interpret it as an addition to line 14.</span><br><br>
      <span id="EXTRASPACE1">Line 16&#x2014;The extra space following <i>it</i> appears to function as terminal punctuation;

                    as an addition to the front of the line, suggests that Ruskin was playing with the sense of <i>reflect</i> in line 22 as both a transitive and intransitive verb.</span><br><br>
