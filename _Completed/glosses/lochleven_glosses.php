      <span id="ISYOURCASTLETHERE">&#x201C;Lochleven is your castle there&#x201D; (MS III)&#x2014;On an island in the lake stands <span class="placeName-LOCHLEVENCAS">Loch Leven Castle</span>,
                    where <span class="persName-MQS">Mary, Queen of Scots</span>, was imprisoned, and where she was forced to abdicate 
                    to her infant son in <span class="date-1567">1567</span>, who became <span class="persName-KJ6">James VI</span>. In <span class="date-1568">1568</span>, 
                    she escaped from the castle, an episode that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have known from <span class="title-SCOTTABBOT">The Abbot</span> (<span class="date-1820">1820</span>) 
                    by <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>. 
                    In <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s telling of the story, <span class="persName-MQS">Mary</span> is abetted in her escape by the young page,

                    and assists <span class="persName-MQS">Mary</span> and her attendants to a waiting boat (vol. 3, chap. 8 &#x005B;<span class="date-1820">1820</span>&#x005D;).</span><br><br>

                    refers to the cry raised by <span class="persName-MQS">Queen Mary</span>&#x02BC;s escape (i.e., &#x201C;it is so long since that boat was near, the boat into which the queen stepped&#x201D;). 
                    In <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>&#x02BC;s novel, the dash of the oars wakens a sentinel, who cries: &#x201C;&#x2018;A boat&#x2014;a boat!&#x2014;bring to, or I shoot!&#x2019;†áç
