            <p>Above the first poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> entitled the anthology &#x201C;Poetry&#x201D;; and 
                        following the final poem, he added a colophon:

                        The deletion suggests that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> initially intended the colophon to close specifically the poetry anthology, 
                        but that he reconsidered and made it serve to conclude <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>

               <p>It is not evident specifically where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> found the idea of appending a poetry anthology to his &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; volumes. 
                            No such anthology exists in the Edgeworths&#x02BC; <span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED-italic"><i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></span>,

                            He might have encountered anthologies in numerous ways. One anthology possibly connected with <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> 
                            was <span class="persName-ENFIELD">James Enfield</span>&#x02BC;s anthology for instructing elocution,

                            and presented with &#x201C;apparent desultoriness&#x201D;

                            tells a story explaining the collection&#x02BC;s subtitle, <i>The Juvenile Budget Opened</i>. 
                            A <i>budget</i> can refer to both a collection and its container; 
                            and <i>to open one&#x02BC;s budget</i> can mean both to tap into such a container and figuratively to speak one&#x02BC;s mind 
                            (&#x201C;budget, <i>n.</i>,&#x201D; <i>OED Online</i>). According to the story, 
                            the &#x201C;juvenile budget,&#x201D; <span class="title-lesson-AIKINBARBAULDEVENINGS-italic">Evenings at Home</span>, came to be collected and opened to view 
                            as the result of a &#x201C;domestic plan&#x201D; that was followed by the Fairborne family of Beechgrove for &#x201C;varying . . . &#x005B;the&#x005D; amusements&#x201D; 
                            and &#x201C;promoting the instruction and entertainment of the younger part&#x201D; of the &#x201C;numerous progeny of children of both sexes.&#x201D; 
                            Friends and relations of the family, &#x201C;who were entertained with cheerfulness and hospitality, free from ceremony and parade,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;would frequently produce a fable, a story, or dialogue, adapted to the age and understanding of the young people.&#x201D; These compositions were 
                            &#x201C;always considered as a high favour,&#x201D; so that, &#x201C;when the pieces were once read over, they were carefully deposited by 
                            Mrs. Fairborne in a box, of which she kept the key:
                            <span class="center">None of these &#x005B;writings&#x005D; were allowed to be taken out again till all the children were assembled in the holidays. 
                            It was then made one of the evening amusements of the family to <i>rummage the budget</i>, as their phrase was. 
                            One of the least children was sent to the box, who putting in its little hand, drew out the paper that came next, and brought it into the parlour. 
                            This was then read distinctly by one of the older ones; and after it had undergone sufficient consideration, 
                            another little messenger was dispatched for a fresh supply; and so on. . . . Other children were admitted to tbese readings, 
                            and as the <i>Budget of Beechgrove Hall</i> became somewhat celebrated in the neighbourhood, 
                            its proprietors were at length urged to lay it open to the public. They were induced to comply; and have presented its contents in the promiscuous order 
                            in which they came to hand, which they think will prove more agreeable than a methodical arrangement.

               <p>This preference for &#x201C;pomiscuous&#x201D; ordering is a reminder of the flexibility that was advocated by educationists and their system of &#x201C;practical&#x201D; education. 
                        In the <span class="title-essay-">&#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D;</span> by 
                        <a href="../notes/edgeworth_richard_lovell_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-RLE">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</span></a>, 
                            which prefaces some editions of <span class="title-lesson-EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS-italic">Early Lessons</span>, the writer insists on allowing even greater authority to the child&#x02BC;s 
                            &#x201C;little hand&#x201D;&#x2014;not just to sift at random and convey a reading, as in the case of the Fairborne child, but deliberately to select what reading is best &#x201C;adapted to &#x005B;its&#x005D; age and understanding.&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;Well educated children,&#x201D; Edgeworth writes, &#x201C;are . . . the best judges of what is fit for children&#x201D;; and parents should &#x201C;select what they find upon trial 
                            to be the best for their immediate purpose, and to lay aside the rest for another opportunity.&#x201D; Whereas on the one hand the Edgeworths took care to arrange their books for children as a succession of 
                            age&#x2010;appropriate &#x201C;lessons&#x201D; pitched to the abilities of their readers&#x2014;from the most accessible dialogues in <i>Frank</i>, 
                            to the first part of <i>Harry and Lucy</i>, to <i>Rosamond</i>, and finally to the later parts of <i>Harry and Lucy</i>&#x2014;on the other hand, the Edgeworths emphasized that 
                            &#x201C;different parts of . . . &#x005B;these books&#x005D; are suited to the tastes of different children, as well as to children of different ages&#x201D;

               <p>Judging by the evidence of <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</span></a>, 
                            and the poetry anthology appended to it, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> took advantage of both the graduated progression of the educationists&#x02BC; books and the permission to range at will. 
                        For youngest children, the <span class="title-essay-">&#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D;</span> recommends works by 
                            <span class="persName-JAIKIN">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x2014;first, 
                            <span class="persName-ALB">Barbauld</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-BARBAULDLESSONS-italic">Lessons for Children</span> and <span class="title-anthology-BARBAULDHYMNSINPROSE-italic">Hymns in Prose</span>,

                            While pesumably <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s explosure to some of the works for the nursery in these collections predated his project 
                            in <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>,

                            retains vestiges of that earliest reading. At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ranged freely, often imitating texts beyond his years. 
                            The &#x201C;Address to Mothers&#x201D; recommends acquainting young children with natural history, 
                        but it advises delaying books that &#x201C;teach particular sciences, or distinct branches of knowledge&#x201D;

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reverses this recommended order, by starting with the ambitious

               <p>The anthology brings to the surface <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s identity as a British subject with family ties
                        to <span class="placeName-NBRITAIN">North Britain</span>. &#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D; may be most persuasively understood as a poem, not about an actual threat of military invasion, but about the
                        coalescence of British identity, <span class="placeName-NBRITAIN">North</span> and <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">South</span>, in defiance of the European Other 
                        (see <a href="../apparatuses/the_defiance_of_war_apparatus#DISCUSSION.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-THEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</span>: Discussion</a>).
                        Patriotism is supported by pride in late&#x2010;Enlightenment invention and entrepreneurship epitomized by

               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have realized that industrial progress could be credited to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> no less than to <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. 
                        In <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, where his relations lived, businessmen vied with <span class="placeName-DUNDEE">Dundee</span> to uphold local dignity by establishing 
                        the town&#x02BC;s own steam packet company by <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, just in time to join the considerable steamer activity involved in the state visit by <span class="persName-KG4">George IV</span> to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>

                        At the same time, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> imagines <span class="placeName-NBRITAIN">North Britain</span> as a preserve of preindustrial nature and history,
                        as suggested by <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</span></a>, and by poems in his second poetry anthology,

                            In fact, as scholars have remarked, tourists in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> 
                        accommodated impressions of both improvement and untampered nature, while <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> wrapped such contradictions in a
                        haze of romance (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TOURISMANDIDENTITY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Grenier, <i>Tourism and Identity in Scotland</i></a>, 28, 53).

                            poignantly reveals both <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s longings for his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>, whose business kept him away from home for long periods, 
                            and the boy&#x02BC;s joy in his father&#x02BC;s return. Two poems, <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-THENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</span></a> and

                            probe the uncertainties of safety in a home. A particular threat to security and happiness may lie behind an elegiac note in

                            of the <span class="date-1827-01-01-1827-03-20">death</span> of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin, 
                            <span class="persName-JRP">James Richardson</span>. 
                            At the same time, if these poems reveal anxieties, the poems also work to resolve such tensions.
