            <p>Ruled notebook, reddish marbled paper boards, three&#x2010;quarter&#x2010;bound in black leather; 14.5 cm (width) &#x00D7; 23.5 cm (height).</p>
            
            <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own page numbering begins with the first verso, which is the verso of the flyleaf. 
                        (The page following the flyleaf appears to have been pasted to the flyleaf, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbering its verso as p. 1, while the original recto of this page is not visible.) 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s unorthodox numbering of versos using odd numbers continues to p. 43. 
                        Then, although no pages appear to have been removed, p. 43 (a verso) is followed by p. 45 (the facing recto). 
                        A sign that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> attempted to correct the anomaly slightly earlier appears on the facing spread, pp. 39&#x2013;40, 
                        where he scored the zero of the numeral 40 with either a slash or a numeral 1. 
                        On the following two&#x2010;page spread, however, he kept to his previous system, and numbered the verso as 41, and the recto as 42. 
                        Only on the next spread, p. 43 (verso) facing p. 45 (recto), does the numbering change to the conventional odd&#x2010;numbering of rectos.
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried the new numbering through p. 55 (with numbering appearing only on the rectos, pp. 51, 53, and 55, and their facing versos left unnumbered).
            </p>
            
            <p>With the cessation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s numbering, thereafter another hand&#x2014;most 
                        likely <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s, when he was analyzing the manuscript&#x02BC;s <a href="#COLLATION">Collation</a>&#x2014;numbered 
                        leaves in pencil on the rectos, starting with 56 and carrying through 72. 
                        What would be leaves 73&#x2013;75 are left blank, and the same hand picks up again with 76&#x2013;79. 
                        Again, a blank is left for 80, but 81 is written above &#x201C;p. 106&#x201D;&#x2014;the latter notation surely the remnant of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        effort to follow through with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original page numbering system in order to deduce what he calls the &#x201C;stratification&#x201D; of the notebook 
                        (see <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;</span>, in which he references &#x201C;p. 106&#x201D; 
                        &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (4<sup>o</sup>, 1891)</a>,
                        1:264&#x2013;65; <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (8<sup>o</sup>, 1891)</a>, 1: 265&#x2013;66&#x005D;).
            </p>
            
            <p>After 82, the later, editorial hand abandons numbering leaves, and the next numbering to appear is again <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own. 
                        On what would be 125r for the later hand, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> begins numbering pages for his play 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/marcolini_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-drama-JRMARCOLINI">&#x201C;Marcolini&#x201D;</span></a>, pp. 1&#x2013;8. Oddly, he left blank what would have been pp. 9&#x2013;39, 
                        but began numbering again, accurately, with p. 40 (a verso) through p. 63 (a recto). 
                        Four more unnumbered pages of the play remain, followed by seven more leaves (the last, like the first, glued to the endpaper).

               <p><a href="#SECTIONA"><i>Section a</i></a> of Contents, below, agrees broadly with <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s section (<i>a</i>) in his description. 
                        From <span class="date-1831-08-22-1831-09-21">August or September 1831</span> through no later than <span class="date-1833-05-10">10 May 1833</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started entering draft in the first blank pages following the notebook&#x02BC;s front flyleaf and worked forward, 
                        apparently with little deviation from sequential order. A major project sustained throughout this first portion of the notebook&#x02BC;s stratification is the epic poem, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted in stints of two to five stanzas, the stints appearing intermittently amid shorter poems. 
                        This procedure is consistent with how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> worked in 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSVI">MS VI</span></a>, 
                        a rough&#x2010;draft notebook used from <span class="date-1830-09-1830-12">late 1830</span> through <span class="date-1831">1831</span>. 
                        In that earlier manuscript, too, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> alternated draft of the epic&#x2010;length travel poem, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/the_iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">&#x201C;The Iteriad&#x201D;</span></a>, with composition of shorter poems. 
                        In fact, the two epic projects overlap briefly at the beginning of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        with a small portion of the fourth book of <a href="../apparatuses/the_iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">&#x201C;The Iteriad&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        situated immediately following the notebook&#x02BC;s first stint of <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span></a> stanzas 
                        (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p>Within <a href="#SECTIONA">section <i>a</i></a> of the Contents, 
                        two subsections can be discerned: <a href="LISTA1">list <i>a</i>.1</a>, 
                        terminating approximately with draft related to an occasional work celebrating <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1832-05-10">10 May 1832</span> birthday, 
                        draft that presumably was originally followed by a hiatus in composition during the family&#x02BC;s summer 
                        <a href="../notes/tour_of_1832_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1832</a> to <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> and <span class="placeName-DOVER">Dover</span>; and 
                        <a href="#SECTIONA2">list <i>a</i>.2</a>, likewise terminating with draft related to 
                        <span class="persName-JJR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s father&#x02BC;s</span> birthday&#x2014;this for <span class="date-1833-05-10">10 May 1833</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p>The subsection, <a href="#LISTA1">list <i>a</i>.1</a>, 
                        represents by far the greater amount of poetic activity, this period marked by the completion in draft and fair copy of one epic, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/the_iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRITERIAD">&#x201C;The Iteriad&#x201D;</span></a>; 
                        the inception (if not completion) in draft and fair copy of another epic, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php#ATHENS" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span></a>; and the drafting of the more than thirty shorter poems in 
                        list <i>a</i>.1 of Contents, 
                        many of which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair&#x2010;copied in <span class="title-manuscript-MSV">MS V</span>. 
                        The poetry in this section returns repeatedly to the locale and imagery associated with <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, 
                        where the family had journeyed for the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1831_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1831</a>, 
                        immediately prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first use of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                        (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p>The following subsection, <a href="LISTA2">list <i>a</i>.2</a>, 
                        is considerably briefer, with no major poetic projects such as epics, and only about five shorter poems 
                        represented in this list. The topographical orientation shifts from <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> and the <span class="placeName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span>, 
                        and the Scottish associations are solemnized by the death of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, 
                        for whom <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote an elegy. A precise demarcation of <a href="#LISTA2">list <i>a</i>.2</a> from 
                        <a href="#LISTA1">list <i>a</i>.1</a> is open to argument, however, 
                        with differing scenarios placing the last known stanza of <span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span> prior to or following the 
                        <a href="../notes/tour_of_1832_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1832</a>. 
                        The break indicated in this analysis between <a href="#LISTA1">list <i>a</i>.1</a> and 
                        <a href="#LISTA2">list <i>a</i>.2</a> should be regarded as provisional, 
                        subject to the caveats discussed at length in 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span>: Date</a>. 
                        In any case, the <span class="title-poem-ATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span> project withered in this subsequent period of comparative poetic austerity.
               </p>
               
               <p>Following <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1833-05-10">10 May 1833</span> birthday, 
                        represented in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> by

                        the family departed on the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1833</a>. 
                        Thus, what may in retrospect be considered the end of section <i>a</i>, and the start of a new major section of the notebook, <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a>, 
                        is declared by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s ceasing work on <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php#ATHENS" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span></a> (at least as composed here), 
                        as his long poem of choice. In its place, he gave his attention to drafting the metrical and prose journal relating to the 
                        <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1833</a>, the

               </p>
               
               <p>In this new section of the manuscript, no title declares the segue to the new project, which is listed in Contents as <a href="SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a>. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had begun drafting the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account𠇍</span> elsewhere, a stage of the project represented by sheets now bound in

                        In <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, following <a href="../apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRMONTHOFMAY">&#x201C;My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday: The Month of May&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> merely drew a horizontal line; and, below this, he composed lines that, in the

                        as the lines seemed &#x201C;descriptive, probably, of the <span class="placeName-ALPS">Alps</span>&#x201D;&#x2014;the lines, namely,

                        In the absence of a title definitively identifying where the draft for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> begins, this brief lyric cannot be proven to belong to the longer work; 
                        however, these lines do immediately precede the prose segment, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON" target="_blank"><span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span></a>, and 
                        and the lyric, <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        (the latter entitled by the editors as <span class="title-poem-JRARVEATCHAMOUNI">&#x201C;The Arve at Chamouni𠇍</span>)&#x2014;and these two drafts can persuasively be identified with the plan of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                        Either immediately before or after <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JROHARETHERESPIRITS" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        there would have occurred a gap during which the family was touring the Continent, unless <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> with him. 
                        See <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>: Date</a>, 
                        where I argue that, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began the work soon after returning from the journey (if not during it), he took up this section of 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> in <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834</span>.

               <p>To determine the probability of what draft in <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                        that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        one looks to the fair copy of the work in <a href="../apparatuses/msix_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span></a> and, since the fair copy is incomplete, 
                        also to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s ambitious 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS" target="_blank"><span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>, 
                        compiled on the inside back endboard and flyleaf of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                        (see below, Contents, <a href="#SECTIONJ">section <i>j</i></a>). 
                        See <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#APPARATUSTABLE1" target="_blank">Table 1</a> in the apparatus for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        to compare the sequence of the prose and verse sections of the work as these appear in the various draft and fair&#x2010;copy witnesses and in the proposed plan for the work.
               </p>
               
               <p>There are other clues, albeit indirect and even obscure ones, tending to confirm whether the prose and verse drafts in this <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                        were intended for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                        First, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s page numbering, pp. 1&#x2013;55, 
                        appears to demarcate what we are here designating as <a href="#SECTIONA">section <i>a</i></a> of the manuscript, 
                        the section devoted to <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span></a> along with shorter poems, 
                        from <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a>, 
                        devoted to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. The last work in section <i>a</i>, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRMONTHOFMAY">&#x201C;My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday: The Month of May</span>&#x201D;</a>, 
                        concludes on p. 53. Only two more numbered pages extend into what is likely composition of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                        with the following leaves of what we are calling section <i>b</i> left unnumbered, 
                        as if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> regarded his earlier page numbering as unrelated to the new project.
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> having left off page numbering, he associates the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> instead with a system of line numbering 
                        for the verse (not for the prose passages). This line numbering appears also in the <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> witnesses, 
                        which were written earlier than the pieces in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. In the latter, the line numbering commences with the fifth line of 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JROHARETHERESPIRITS" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-JROHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span></a>&#x2014;seemingly 
                        the most direct evidence that this lyric was meant for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigns the fifth line the number &#x201C;510,&#x201D; 
                        and the tenth line &#x201C;515.&#x201D; Four more lines take the poem to the bottom of the page (p. 53). 
                        The following page, a verso, plus a third of the next recto are taken up by the prose piece, <span class="title-essay-JRSOURCEOFTHEARVERON">&#x201C;The Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</span>, 
                        which of course is unaccompanied by line numbers; and then the line numbering resumes with &#x201C;520&#x201D; assigned to the next occurring verse, 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRIWOKETOHEARTHELULLABY">&#x201C;I woke to hear the lullaby&#x201D;</span> (p. 55)&#x2014;correctly a continuation from line 519 at the bottom of p. 53.
               </p>
               
               <p>Clearly, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started this line numbering in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> from 506, 
                        he had already initiated the system elsewhere; and this antecedent appears represented by the aforementioned draft of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                        in <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span></a>. This draft, which consists of three separate sheets, 
                        contains verse that is line&#x2010;numbered on the three sheets, respectively as 1&#x2013;51, 52&#x2013;204, and 324&#x2013;429. 
                        (We cannot be certain that the line numbered originated with these drafts of verse in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIA">MS IA</span> and 
                        <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have carried over line&#x2010;numbering 
                        from some earlier draft, now lost.)
               </p>
               
               <p>It is tempting to read the line numbering as a relic of the original sequence of composition. This possibility is not necessarily derailed by certain anomalies, 
                        such as its extending into works toward the end of <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> that certainly are not intended for the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> (e.g., <a href="../apparatuses/the_crystal_hunter_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRCRYSTALHUNTER">&#x201C;The Crystal Hunter&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        while it lapses from verse that seems consistent with the topographical work (e.g., 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/the_lake_smiled_sweetly.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRTHELAKESMILEDSWEETLY">&#x201C;The lake smiled sweetly, and the boy&#x201D;</span></a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>In short, <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> contains 
                        some evidence apart from the content of the texts themselves of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s pattern of composition. 
                        This pattern shows that, in this section, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s activity was as homogeneous as it had been varied in <a href="#SECTIONA">section <i>a</i></a>. 
                        Not that he had become single&#x2010;minded in his pursuits. Throughout the first half of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, while continuing composition of the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, 
                        along with the work&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying and illustration in <a href="../apparatuses/msix_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span></a>, 
                        he continued his lessons with tutors, and other kinds of writing&#x2014;scientific, mathematical, and probably theological (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). 
                        Rather, <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> reflects more distinct categorization and focus in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        pursuits&#x2014;both focused on a single literary work within this section of as <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, and divided into distinct 
                        disciplinary activity in other noteboooks. At the same time, the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> project in itself became defined by 
                        a principle of mixed kinds, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> elaborated what was originally a solely verse travelogue into a composite&#x2010;genre prose and verse, and illustrated travelogue, 
                        which reflected the miscellaneity and burgeoning technologies in the print culture of travel literature in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                        Moreover, the intensity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s focus was rewarded in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when he was commissioned to revise 
                        a portion of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, as well as to compose a new topographical poem, 
                        as his first widely distributed, professional poetry publications&#x2014;the poems published in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath . . . for MDCCCXXXV</i></a>

               </p>
               
               <p>The sequence of verse and prose sections of the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, as composed in 
                        <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, does not conform 
                        with their sequence as fair&#x2010;copied. Sections that appear relatively early in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> fair copy&#x2014;such 
                        as the prose sections for <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII" target="_blank"><span class="title-essay-JRBRUSSELSPROSE1_MSVIII">#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D;"</span> &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</a>,

                        of the work recounting the journey through northern <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, 
                        and <span class="placeName-PRUSSIA">Prussia</span>&#x2014;are intermixed with sections that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> destined for the later 
                        Italian and Swiss stages of the work (sections that, as it happened, he never around to fair&#x2010;copying). Thus, the sequence of composition 
                        reflects the pace of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying in <span class="title-manuscript-MSIX">MS IX</span> 
                        while he was simultaneously composing prose and verse for the later portions of the work. This process comes to a halt 
                        when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s energies are deflected into revising and composing for <span class="title-periodical-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</span>, 
                        and also into preparing occasional poems for his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1834-05">May 1834</span> birthday. 
                        Understanding this endpoint of <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> requires considerable revision of 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s timeline for composition of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>,

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> calculated that, by the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reached this page, 
                        he had been composing the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> through about <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span>. 
                        Then at this point, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> says, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> skipped ahead in the manuscript to compose 
                        New Year&#x02BC;s and birthday odes for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>; he then returned to pp. 105&#x2013;6, where he had left off drafting the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, in order to compose a poem connected with the

                        This is incorrect, as argued in <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPPUB" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</a>,

                        To compose the poem, <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span></a>, moreover, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not <i>return</i> to this place in the notebook after having jumped ahead; rather, he composed it

               <p><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> proposed a more complicated &#x201C;stratification&#x201D; of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s layerings 
                        of writing in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, because he incorrectly assumed that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have written about a place, 
                        <span class="placeName-SALZBURG">Salzburg</span>, only if he had visited the city, whereas <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first visit to the city

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> based his poem, not on an experience of tourism, but on an ekphrastic description of an engraved view of the city. The plate

                        in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> is more accurately understood as a sequential extension of the 
                        <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> project&#x2014;in the sense, not that this poem was ever intended for that project, 
                        but that, as an ekphrastic and topographical poem, it can be viewed as the culmination of what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was exploring in the longer composite work&#x2014;the 
                        end of <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> is also cluttered with draft that is unrelated or only questionably related 
                        to the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. A prose work immediately following the

                        Other works mixed among the later pieces drafted for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> are clearly purposed 
                        to celebrate <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May 1834</span> birthday, and thus help to date

                  <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was working on the latter, the &#x201C;Geological poem,&#x201D; at the time of a <span class="date-1834-02-22">22 February 1834</span> letter 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 280), but his composition of these works in 
                        <a href="#LISTB2">list <i>b.</i>2,</a> probably carried at least well into <span class="date-1834-03-1834-04">March&#x2013;April 1834</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p>Presumably, this section of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> concluded with the family&#x02BC;s departure for the 
                        <a href="../notes/tour_of_1834_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1834</a>. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s idea was that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> left blank the pages following <a href="#SECTIONB">section <i>b</i></a> in order to leave space 
                        for continuing to draft the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>,

                        That reconstruction does conform logically with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s compiling on the back endboards the 
                        <span class="title-bibliography_text-JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account of a Tour on the Continent</span>. 
                        What came to fill this space, following on 82r sequentially from <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>, is writing that 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> assumed to be related to the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1835_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1835</a>. 
                        While his idea was prompted by a misreading of the date and occasion of <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>, the hand used on 82r 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/ascent_of_the_st_bernard_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-drama-JRASCENTSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Ascent of the St. Bernard: A Dramatic Sketch&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        does appear in a distinctly lighter ink; and the following group of sketches, tales, and lyrics may indeed form a chronologically distinct section of the notebook 
                        (<a href="#SECTIONE">section <i>e</i></a>), which was inspired by travel to the Continent in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, 
                        the pieces being set on the <span class="placeName-STBERNARD">St. Bernard</span> and in <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span>. The pieces can equally 
                        be associated, like <span class="title-poem-JRSALTZBURG">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</span>, with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing 
                        for the annuals; and he may have used the blank section of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> following that poem precisely because of that association.
               </p>
               
               <p>Where in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span>, then, did <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> go for continuing use of the manuscript following 
                        the family&#x02BC;s return from (or during) the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1834_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1834</a>? 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> pegged this new start on &#x201C;p. 168&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i></span> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>,

                        This is a recto, 112r, on which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s penciled notation is still visible in the upper right corner. 
                        Physical evidence does support the suggestion of a new departure at this point, with the poetry running up to this recto on the facing verso being suddenly crowded into two columns&#x2014;an 
                        unusual format for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in the bound notebooks, and suggesting that he ran up against an obstacle on 112r. 
                        This section of <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> starting on 112r (Contents, <a href="SECTIOND">section <i>d</i></a>) 
                        begins with a poem for <span class="date-1835-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1835</span>,

                        If this is where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> resumed work following the <span class="date-1834">1834</span> tour, he would have skipped 30 leaves (from 82r,

                        Thirty leaves forms a great length of space, but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s plans for the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>

               <p><span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> contains a second probable instance of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s having skipped ahead

                        Upside&#x2010;down to the front of the notebook, and running reverso from the opposite end (and separated from the main text by blank leaves), 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed a small group of poems (Contents, <a href="SECTIONC">section <i>c</i></a>)

                        no fair&#x2013;copy presentation version of this poem is known to survive; and therefore, the stint of composition in <a href="SECTIONC">section <i>c</i></a>

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s suggestion cannot be correct, however, since <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span> is already known 
                        to culminate in <a href="../apparatuses/as_i_was_walking_round_by_peckham_rye_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRPECKHAMRYE">&#x201C;As I was walking round by Peckham rye&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        as its  the New Year&#x02BC;s ode. Thus, in order to date <a href="SECTIONC">section <i>c</i></a>, we must consider another 
                        New Year&#x02BC;s date that falls within the range of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s work in <span class="title-manuscript-MSVIII">MS VIII</span> 
                        and that lacks a known New Year&#x02BC;s ode. Possible dates are 1 January <span class="date-1832-01-01">1832</span>, <span class="date-1833-01-01">1833</span>, <span class="date-1834-01-01">1834</span>, 
                        and <span class="date-1836-01-01">1836</span>. Of these, <span class="date-1832-01-01">1 January 1832</span> can be eliminated, although not definitely, as the date of

                        Some evidence supports <span class="date-1834-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1834</span> as the date for

                        and thus circa <span class="date-1834-12">December 1833</span> for <a href="SECTIONC">section <i>c</i></a>, 
                        since the group includes <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem on dancing,

                        A more impressionistic case might be made for assigning for <a href="SECTIONC">section <i>c</i></a> to a year earlier, 
                        circa <span class="date-1834-12">December 1832</span>, and <a href="../apparatuses/the_dawn_is_breaking_on_the_bending_hills_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRDAWNISBREAKING">&#x201C;The dawn is breaking on the bending hills&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        to <span class="date-1833-01-01">1 January 1833</span>, based on the poem&#x02BC;s solemn tone, which speaks to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s

               </p>
               
               <p>We can reasonably conclude, then, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> produced Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIONC">c</a></i> as a stint of writing distinct from what he was drafting elsewhere 
                        in MS VIII at the time, but we cannot be certain whether that time was in <span class="date-1832-12-21-1832-03-20">winter 1832</span>, prior to New Year&#x02BC;s, or in <span class="date-1833-12-21-1833-03-20">winter 1833</span>, prior to that holiday; 
                        oppositely, we can conclude with certainty that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> produced 
                        Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i> prior to <span class="date-1834-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s in winter 1834</span>, but we cannot be confident that this section represents a distinct stint, produced at a different time 
                        from what immediately precedes it. If another distinct stint is represented by the 30 leaves between section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i>, starting on 112r, and the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project that, 
                        along with the associated revision and composition for Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering, left off at 82r in <span class="date-1834-06-21-1834-07-22">early summer 1834</span>, 
                        then we can conceive of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> returning to these available 30 leaves following the family&#x02BC;s second major Continental tour, 
                        the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1835_html" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1835</a>, undertaken between <span class="date-1835-06">June</span> and <span class="date-1835-12">December</span>, 
                        since much of the writing filling that space is at least thematically related to places the family visited. In <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> interpretation, this post&#x2010;tour writing of <span class="date-1835-09-1835-12">late 1835</span> and <span class="date-1836">1836</span> 
                        carries forward to <span class="date-1838">1838</span> with lyric poems dedicated to <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle Domecq</span>, before running up against the pre&#x2010;existing section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i> of <span class="date-1834-09-1834-12">late 1834</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> bases this surprising terminus ad quem on the date of <span class="date-1838">1838</span> he assigns to 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/memory_the_summer_wind_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRMEMORYTHESUMMERWIND">&#x201C;Memory&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;The summer wind is soft and kind&#x201D;&#x005D;</span></a>. 
                        In fact, the sequence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> use of MS VIII may be even more complicated after Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i>, and his use of the 30 blank leaves requires subdividing 
                        into Contents, section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>, section <i><a href="SECTIONF">f</a></i>, and section <i><a href="SECTIONG">g</a></i>.
                    
               </p>
               
               <p>In assessing <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> interpretation, one should bear in mind that the major metrical account of the <span class="date-1835">1835</span> tour, the 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/journal_of_a_tour_through_france_to_chamouni_1835_apparatus.php#JRJOURNALTOURFRANCE" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Journal of a Tour through France to Chamouni, 1835&#x201D;</a>, 
                        does not appear to be represented in MS VIII. 
                        In fact, no draft at all is known of the poem, its fair&#x2010;copy presentation alone surviving, in <a href="../apparatuses/msx_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS X</a>. 
                        Even in this form, this latest topographical poem proved less ambitious than the 1833&#x2013;34 &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; in that the &#x201C;Journal&#x201D; is not a composite of verse and prose, 
                        and its fair copy lacks illustrations or an engraving&#x2010;like 
                        &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> apparently found sufficient ambition in imitating <span class="persName-GGB">Byron&#x02BC;s</span> 
                        Spenserian stanza from <i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i>. 
                        What the initial use of the 30 leaves, section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i> of MS VIII, may represent, then, 
                        is the variety of genre that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> filtered out, as it were, 
                        from his major metrical poem for the <span class="date-1835">1835</span> tour, as compared with the elaborately composite, illustrated &#x201C;Account&#x201D; produced in response to the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour.
               </p>
               
               <p>As already cautioned, however, it is possible that, in filling the 30 leaves with a variety of genres&#x2014;for example, a dramatic sketch, a tale&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was pursuing the thrill 
                        of publishing in the gift annuals. He may have begun section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>  
                        in the second half of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, composing such works as 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/ascent_of_the_st_bernard_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-drama-JRASCENTSTBERNARD">&#x201C;The Ascent of the St. Bernard: A Dramatic Sketch&#x201D;</span></a> and 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/leoni_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</span></a>, not owing to visits the family would pay to the Hospice of <span class="placeName-STBERNARD">St. Bernard</span> and <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span> in <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, 
                        but because sketches and tales were germane to the literary annuals in which he had made his debut in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1835">35</span>. The family crossed the <span class="placeName-STBERNARD">St. Bernard</span> also in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>; 
                        and one did not need to experience <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span> first&#x2010;hand to wield the popular literary imagining of its setting. Regarded in that light, 
                        one can imagine the stint of writing in section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i> flowing sequentially and chronologically into the <span class="date-1834-09-1834-12">late&#x2010;1834</span> section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i>; 
                        or, if the latter did pre&#x2010;exist some portion of section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>, the writing in section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i> 
                        may extend from <span class="date-1834-05-1834-08">mid&#x2010;1834</span> only until <span class="date-1835">1835</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1836">36</span>, and not as late as <span class="date-1838">1838</span>, as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> believed.
               </p>
               
               <p>If section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i> does flow into <span class="date-1835">1835</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1836">36</span>, the <span class="persName-PBS">Shelleyan</span> quality of some of its lyrics may reflect the arrival 
                        of <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle Domecq</span> and her sisters at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> in <span class="date-1836-01">January 1836</span>. 
                        The story in <i>Praeterita</i> about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> infatuation with <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle</span> suggests an abrupt swerve to <span class="persName-PBS">Shelleyan</span> 
                        love poetry; however, the sequence of supposedly <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle</span>-inspired poems in MS VIII (section <i><a href="SECTIONG">g</a></i>)
                        is continuous with the tour&#x2010;inspired shorter poems in section <i><a href="SECTIONE">e</a></i>. 
                        A transition between the two groups is marked by <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venetian</span> pieces that can be associated as much 
                        with the <span class="persName-GGB">Byronic</span> romance of the Continent as with adolescent worship of <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle Domecq</span>. 
                        For <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> idea that section <i><a href="SECTIONG">g</a></i> should be understood as extending into <span class="date-1837">1837</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1838">38</span>, 
                        see <a href="../apparatuses/memory_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRMEMORY">&#x201C;Memory&#x201D;</span></a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>Following the <span class="date-1834-09-1834-12">late&#x2010;1834</span> section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i> occurs a small group of poems that may be simply an extension of section <i><a href="SECTIOND">d</a></i> into <span class="date-1835-01-1835-04">early 1835</span>, 
                        but that may constitute a distinct section <i><a href="SECTIONF">f</a></i> from a later time. Following this group, 
                        in <span class="date-1836-05">May 1836</span>, during the early stage of the <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle</span> sequence in <i><a href="SECTIONG">g</a></i>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used some more space (section <i><a href="SECTIONH">h</a></i>) to draft his father&#x02BC;s birthday ode, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/congratu_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Congratu&#x2014;&#x201D;</a>. 
                        After this, he continued with the verse drama <a href="../apparatuses/marcolini_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-drama-JRMARCOLINI">&#x201C;Marcolini𠇍</span></a>, for many pages.
               </p>
               
               <p>The remainder of the contents of MS VIII, sections <i><a href="SECTIONI">i</a></i> and <i><a href="SECTIONK">k</a></i>, consists of slight sketches and lesson work.

               <p>Following the initial sequence, section <i>a</i>, which ends with the draft of his ode celebrating <span class="date-1833-05-10">John James&#x02BC;s May 1833 birthday</span>,
                            <a href="../apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRMONTHOFMAY">&#x201C;My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday: The Month of May&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> devoted the next sequence in MS VIII to the draft lyrics and prose passages that make up the topographical work, 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPPUB" target="_blank"><span class="title-composition-JRCOMPPUB">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>. The work describes the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> family&#x02BC;s 
                            <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1833</a>, on which they departed immediately following <span class="date-1833-05-10">John James&#x02BC;s birthday</span>; however, there is no evidence 
                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried MS VIII with him on the tour, or that these entries represent impressions taken down en route. 
                            Rather, the MS VIII drafts all but certainly represent a stage of the work that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> initiated elsewhere, 
                            one represented by sheets containing draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; that survive in <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> (although even these sheets may not necessarily date from the tour itself). 
                            The <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> sheets represent not only an earlier stage but also a somewhat different version of the work, conceptualized as exclusively verse rather than as a composite genre 
                            (see <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#COMPPUB" target="_blank"><span class="title-composition-COMPPUB">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Composition and Publication</span></a>). 
                            The MS VIII draft takes up in mid&#x2010;progress of the second, composite version; 
                            and as explained in the <a href="DESCRIPTION">Description</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears to declare this new sequence in the notebook&#x2014;not, unfortunately, with a title 
                            demarcating the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x2014;but with a system of line numbering, which starts at line 506, evidently assigned to the first line of the first poem of the project to be drafted in MS VIII. 
                            Clearly, the line numbering shows a continuation from elsewhere&#x2014;logically, from a system represented on the sheets in <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a>.
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;</span> nowhere explicitly explains his purpose in numbering the lines, 
                            and he is inconsistent in itsh practice. Thus, while we interpret section <i>b</i> of MS VIII as starting with the first poem to be marked with this line numbering, 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#OHARETHERESPIRITS" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-OHARETHERESPIRITS">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            one cannot be certain that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended this poem for 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#ASINTENTIONLINE" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-ASINTENTIONLINE">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>, as the intention of the line numbering is obscure, 
                            the poem's content is not explicitly topographical, and no title declares the onset of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project. 
                            Beyond this first lyric, the content of the entries do become clearly topographical, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> titles sections of prose and poetry with place names 
                            related to the tour. At a certain point in section <i>b</i>, however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            mixes the sequence of pieces for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; with writing from <span class="date-2011-03-20-1834-06-21">Spring 1834</span> 
                            that is identifiable with other purposes, such celebrating <span class="persName-JJR">John James&#x02BC;s</span> birthday, and yet he does abandon the line numbering. Thus, the first portion of Contents, section <i>b</i>, 
                            which appears devoted exclusively to the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is designated section <i>b.1</i>, while the stint that suddenly becomes miscellaneous is designated 
                            section <i>b.2</i>

                                    nor in the version printed in the Library Edition. Since this sentence falls at the bottom of 65v, it may have served <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as a marker of some kind, interrupting (or egging on) his rough&#x2010;drafting. 
                                    On the following recto, 66r, the remainder of the prose passage is drafted (from &#x201C;Saw Charlemagnes easy chair . . .&#x201D; to &#x201C;Goodnight&#x201D;). 
                                    The remainder of 66r is filled with two rough sketches in ink&#x2014;one of mountains (including a volcano?), and one of palaces and boats on a canal, probably a <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venetian</span> subject&#x2014;bearing no resemblance

                                    parallel with the final line (66r). Following this, in the margin at the right of the drawings, appear the numbers 925 and 930. The latter numbering. which is continuous with 890&#x2013;920 assigned to 
                                    the preceding item, <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JRITWASANEVEOFSUMMERMILD2" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-JRITWASANEVEOFSUMMERMILD2">&#x201C;It was an eve of summer, mild&#x201D;</span></a> (64v&#x2013;65r), evidently awaited

                                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not begin numbering from 921, where he actually left off at the end of

                                    Another anomaly is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> line numbering, which overlaps with that for

                                    Since the manuscript gives every appearance of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> working steadily and sequentially, with no crowding of lines indicating a collision of numbering systems&#x2014;such

                                        perhaps because <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not include the poem&#x02BC;s dozen lines in his system of line numbering&#x2014;which jumps from 1159, 
                                        at the end of the preceding section, <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#JRSCHAFFHAUSEN" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-JRSCHAFFHAUSEN">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                                        to 1160, at the start of the following section. As remarked earlier, however, the significance of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> line numbering is obscure, and the numbering is not always consistent in itself. 
                                        No other factor argues for excluding the poem; its style and content of the poem appears consistent with other verse for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                        and the manuscript shows no crowding or change in compositional proecedure&#x2014;a line space neatly dividing the poem from the poem &#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D; preceding it,

                                        A possible reason for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> passing over numbering the lines of <a href="../apparatuses/the_lake_smiled_sweetly.php#JRLAKESMILEDSWEETLY" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRLAKESMILEDSWEETLY">&#x201C;The lake smiled sweetly, and the boy&#x201D;</span></a> 
                                        is that he intended to connect the beginning of &#x201C;Not such the night whose stormy might&#x201D; (1160) with the end (1159) of

                                        Incomplete here, the composition is resumed on 77r, below. 
                                        With &#x201C;The Vintage,&#x201D; is is clear that, at this point in MS VIII, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> departed temporarily from composition of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; 
                                        to prepare birthday odes for <span class="date-1834-05-10">his father&#x02BC;s May 1834 anniversary</span>. 
                                        The manuscript shows no signs of crowding, but it is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had skipped ahead in MS VIII to compose &#x201C;The Vintage,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Address,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Crystal Hunter,&#x201D; 
                                        and later wrapped the continuing &#x201C;Account&#x201D; material around these drafts. He may have begun &#x201C;The Crystal Hunter&#x201D; in the middle of 72v and inserted the first 21 lines of &#x201C;The Vintage&#x201D; 
                                        in the blank space preceding &#x201C;The Crystal Hunter,&#x201D; or he may have started composition of &#x201C;The Vintage&#x201D; and temporarily halted it to work on &#x201C;The Crystal Hunter.&#x201D; 
                                        More intriguing than the order of composition is whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant &#x201C;The Vintage&#x201D; to belong to the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; or to the <span class="date-1834-05-10">1834 birthday</span> odes&#x2014;or to stand on its own as a separate composition. 
                                        The editors of the Library Edition evidently did not know what to make of the poem and left it unpublished. 
                                        Indeed, while the opening description in &#x201C;The Vintage&#x201D; of grape harvesting on the Continent might connect the poem with the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                        its comic quarrel between casks of wine in a cellar seems out of keeping with the topographical work 
                                        as do the poem&#x2019;s octameter couplets.

                                        Of the competing systems of line numbering attached to the poem, that starting at 1183 picks up from line 1182 that closes

                                        The alternate starting with line 1 and numbering at intervals of 5 is abandoned after stanza 11 apparently because, after stanza 12, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> transposed stanzas.

                                        even about the poem&#x02BC;s connection to the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; The poem&#x02BC;s meter, however, is consistent with those used in the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D;

                                        Following line 21, he copies but then scores through the final line of the previously drafted segment (&#x201C;A little space of time&#x201D;); that is, 
                                        he omits copying, but apparently intends to include, the intervening 22 lines between the repeated opening and closing lines of the former draft&#x2014;that closing line forming 
                                        line 44 of the new &#x201C;Genoa,&#x201D; if the intervening lines are included. The join is indicated further by three <i>x</i>s above the scored line, &#x201C;A little space of time,&#x201D; 
                                        which seems to correspond to four asterisks that follow this line in the earlier draft on 64v. Following these crude directions to incorporate the earlier draft 
                                        appear three more lines that are scored through (&#x201C;And think how wide the world must be / Across from pole to pole / When all that there you look upon&#x201D;), but here the strikethrough 
                                        apparently indicates simply rejected draft. Thereafter, the poem&#x02BC;s new draft continues without interruption.

               <p>As it turned out, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not use the 30 leaves between sections <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> for continuation of

                            (or, more precisely, advanced to a more sophisticated level, through revision of parts for publication), Ruskin exploited this space to compose a new stint of miscellaneous works. 
                            Previously, these pieces have been associated with the family&#x02BC;s next trip to the Continent, the

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> possible motivations are complex, including his new experience as an author for the gift annuals, and the topics of these works did not necessarily hinge on first-hand experience of the places involved. 
                            Also, there is no way to determine whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried MS VIII 
                            along with him on the <span class="date-1835">1835</span> journey, except that this was likely not the case in <span class="date-1833">1833</span>.

                            but it is entirely possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed these pieces well before this encounter

                        and possibly into <span class="date-1837">1837</span>, although <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> assigns one work to as late as <span class="date-1838">1838</span>. Work in the manuscript was not continuous, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably putting the notebook aside 
                        at least during the long periods of the Tour of <span class="date-1833">1833</span> and the Tour of <span class="date-1835">1835</span>.

            <p>Like <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a>, MS VIII is a bound, ledger&#x2010;like notebook 
                       that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used for rough&#x2010;drafting poetry and imaginative prose. 
                       Usually shortly following composition here, or even simultaneously, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair&#x2010;copied many of these works in other notebooks. 
                       As analyzed in <a href="COLLATION">Description: Collation</a>, 
                       MS VIII exhibits a pattern similar to that of <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a>, 
                       whereby <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drafted a longer work in stints, 
                       compiling and fair&#x2010;copying the longer work elsewhere, 
                       while also varying the ongoing composition in the rough-draft notebook with brief lyrics between the stints of the epic. 
                       The principal long work developed in this fashion in <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a> is 
                       <a href="../apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;The Iteriad&#x201D;</a>, 
                       the composition of which spills over into the start of MS VIII; and the principal work taking the latter&#x02BC;s place as the extended project in MS VIII is 
                       <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php#JRCOMPPUB" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</a>.
                   
            </p> 
            
            <p>Ruskin fair&#x2010;copied both of these works in MS V and 
                       <a href="../apparatuses/msvii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VII</a>--the latter evidently intended as the showcase for complete fair copies of both poems, 
                       although Ruskin finished copying only <a href="../apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</a>, in January 1832, whereas he barely 
                       starting transcribing "Athens," before abandoning the project. MS V, which relates to MS VIII primarily as a place where Ruskin fair-copied the miscellaneous poems drafted between 
                       the stints of epic, became the vessel for his most extensive fair copy of the unfinished 
                       <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</a>.
                   
            </p>
            
            <p>In the 1831-32 poems--both "Athens" and the briefer, miscellaneous poems 
                        (section <a href="LISTA1"><i>a</i>.1</a>)--MS VIII is strongly associated with travel. 
                        Although Ruskin appears not to have taken MS VIII with him 
                        on family tours, he used the manuscript to explore how to translate memories of landscapes into verse, 
                        referring both directly and obliquely to Welsh scenes he encountered during the 
                        <a href="../notes/tour_of_1831_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1831</a>. 
                        Simultaneously, he was evoking memories of Wales in drawings for his master, 
                        <a href="../notes/runciman_charles_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Charles Runciman (1798-1864)</a>. 
                        While he was perhaps a long way from a sophisticated idea of ekphrasis, his letters to his father suggest that he was developing 
                        some idea of "poetry &#x0026; painting" as sister arts 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 268). 
                        For example, he composed <a href="../apparatuses/llyn_idwal_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Llyn Idwal&#x201D;</a> as a recollection of Wales 
                        probably at about the same time that, according to letters of 20 and 27 February, he "invent&#x005B;ed&#x005D; a scene" based on "models" provided by Runciman, 
                        which, Ruskin thought, "resembled" "the cottage that we saw, as we went to Rhaidyr Dhu, near Maentwrog where the old woman lived whose grandson 
                        went with us to the fall, so very silently" 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a> 262).
                    
            </p> 
            
            <p>When Ruskin showed his drawing to Runciman, the drawing master "contemplated it for a moment in silence, 
                        &#x0026; then turning asked me, if I had copied? I told him how I had patched it up, 
                        but he said that that was not copying, &#x0026; although he was not satisfied with the picture,
                        he said that there was something in it, that would make him totally change the method he had hitherto pursued with me" 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a> 267).
                        
                        In the poems, however, he does not draw on the tradition of topographical landscape description; rather, 
                        he is preoccupied with Byron, turning to that model appropriately for representation of the sublime in mountain and ocean scenery, 
                        the mode of viewing that was typically associated with the tour of northern Wales 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Andrews, <i>The Search for the Picturesque</i></a>, 111). 
                        Somewhat eccentrically, Ruskin fixates less on Byron's descriptive poetry in <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i> as examples of the sublime 
                        than on the gothic elements of mountain and aerial "spirits" in <i>Manfred</i>.
                    
            </p>
            
            <p>
                        Another theme in these letters, which contextualizes 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/aspice_pater_invocationem_apparatus.php#JRASPICEPATER" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Aspice pater invocationem&#x201D;</a>, 
                        is Ruskin's running commentary on his classical studies and his jocular (and often incorrect) usages of Latin and Greek to comment on his lessons and other events 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, e.g. 257, 263, 268-69, 273).
            </p> 
            
            <p>Meanwhile, as had also been the case with draft of shorter works in <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a>, 
                       <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair&#x2010;copied some lyric works from MS VIII into <a href="../apparatuses/msv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS V</a>, 
                       which he entitled &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry,&#x201D; although he left many such works to remain in draft alone, in both <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a> and MS VIII; and he fair&#x2010;copied occasional poetry, such as New Year&#x2010;s and birthday odes, as separate presentation copies 
                            (bound into <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> and <a href="../apparatuses/msxi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS XI</a> by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> editors). This larger pattern of composition and fair&#x2010;copying, overlapping with that for <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a>, is sustained throughout 
                            Contents, section <i>a</i>, from <span class="date-1831-09-22-1831-12-21">fall 1831</span> through <span class="date-1833-03-20-1833-06-21">spring 1833</span>.
            </p>
            
            <p>A change in this pattern emerges when, in Contents, section <i>b</i>, &#x201C;Athens&#x201D; is displaced as the principal long work 
                            by <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>. 
                            The pattern is maintained insofar as Ruskin probably fair&#x2010;copied &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; almost simultaneously, into <a href="../apparatuses/msix_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>, 
                            but composition of &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; differs in taking over the notebook completely, from <span class="date-1833-09-22-1833-12-21">fall 1833</span> through spring and <span class="date-1834-06-21-1834-07-22">early summer 1834</span>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not alternate brief stints of the longer work 
                            with composition of shorter lyrics, except to take up draft of occasional works, for which purpose he jumps ahead to an unused section (e.g., Contents, sections <i>c</i> and 
                            <i>d</i>. This change can be partly explained by the nature of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; itself, which apparently evolved from an exclusively metrical topographical work 
                            into a compound genre, of poetry, prose, and illustration. Composition of the work entailed its own varying of interest and literary/artistic form.
            </p>
            
            <p>As explained in <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Discussion</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> modeled this anthology&#x2010;like approach to composing &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; on publications of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> that exhibit mixed forms dependent on new printing technologies&#x2014;for example, the 
                            topographical work, <i>Italy</i>, by <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>, which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> republished as a popular illustrated book in <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, 
                            its large volume of production and wide distribution made possible by the new stee engraving. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was also imitating the prose writing typical of the illustrated landscape annuals of the period. 
                            Thus, in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; section of MS VIII (section <i>b</i>), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            might be understood as not so much as abandoning his earlier procedure of afternating draft of epic verse with draft of briefer lyrics, 
                            as finding and developing a model for a single project that accommodated his preference for varying genres. In this regard, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> simply aligns his existing compositional habits 
                            with features of publications of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> aimed at the <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">British</span> middle class, especially travel and ekphrastic publication.
                        
            </p>
            
            <p>What must have been somewhat unexpected, however, and what wrenches the use of MS VIII away from the familiar pattern of <a href="../apparatuses/msvi_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VI</a>, 
                            is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself enters that publishing scene in 1834&#x2013;35 as the author, &#x201C;J.R.,&#x201D; 
                            when he becomes a contributor to <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>. 
                            That transition&#x2014;which was brought about by the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; which was mined for the poems making up 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/fragments_from_a_metrical_journal_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a>, published in the gift annual&#x2014;is 
                            most directly represented in MS VIII by the displacement of draft of &#x201C;Account&#x201D; with draft of 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</a>, commissioned specifically to accompany an engraving for the annual. 
                            Perhaps Contents, section <i>e</i> should likewise be understood as a new use for Ruskin of a rough&#x2010;draft notebook, 
                            a use focused less on generating draft for fair&#x2010;copy presentation within the family circle, and more on developing writing for publication. 
                        
            </p>
            
            <p>If so, the question arises of the subsequent relation between public and private writing in MS VIII. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> editors associated sections <i>e</i> and <i>g</i> 
                            with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> alleged crush on <span class="persName-ACD">Adèle Domecq</span>, based on his story in <i>Praeterita</i>, which frames this infatuation in terms of poetic 
                            composition. To understand these sections of MS VIII more clearly, this lyric writing from <span class="date-1835">1835</span> and beyond needs, like &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; to be detached from its autobiographical coloring, 
                            and set in relation to the material culture of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Connected with these questions may be the phenomenon of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> unusally protracted use of MS VIII, 
                            extending perhaps as late as <span class="date-1838">1838</span>.
                        
            </p>
            
            <p>Other work that engaged <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> simultaneously with MS VIII, in addition to the fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts already mentioned, include 
                            the <a href="../apparatuses/sermons_on_the_pentateuch.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sermons on the Pentateuch</a> (MSS IIA&#x2010;E), composed and fair&#x2010;copied <span class="date-1832">1832</span> through <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, and 
                            the Mineralogical Dictionary (MS IVD), compiled <span class="date-1831">1831</span> through <span class="date-1836">1836</span>. The latter helped 
                            sponsor <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> emergence onto the public scene in another role, as a scientific author with papers in The Magazine of Natural History:
