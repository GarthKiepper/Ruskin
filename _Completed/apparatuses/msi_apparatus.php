                    On the same day, he docketed <a href="../apparatuses/msiv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IV</a> as 
                    &#x201C;<a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red book</a> No. 1,&#x201D; and

                    the manuscript, a feature in addition to &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; that

               <p>A loose leaf (not counted in the collation) was inserted between the title page and 1r; it holds a clipping from <a href="../bibiliography/bibilography.php#POEMS8D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (8<sup>o</sup>, 1891)</a> 
                    describing MS I, along with brief remarks possibly in the hand
                    of <a href="../notes/wedderburn_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span></a>. It is
                    not clear in this case whether, for this purpose, an existing notebook leaf was used (e.g.,
                    whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;frontispiece&#x201D; originally began on 2r,
                    following this leaf), or whether a piece of paper was trimmed to the 
                    <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a>&#x02BC;s size and inserted
                    here. The latter is more probable, since similar insertions in other Red Books 
                    (e.g., <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a>) certainly formed no part of the original notebook.
               </p>
               
               <p>Despite <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s erratic page numbering, no leaves appear to be missing,
                    except for pp. 30&#x2013;31, which cause a gap in the text. This missing leaf
                    probably included a &#x201C;plate,&#x201D; <a href="../drawings/D5.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x005B;Plate 4, &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1&#x005D;</a>.
                    The leaf containing plate 5, <a href="../drawings/D6.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Lucy&#x02BC;s Drawing Room,&#x201D; &#x005B;Plate&#x005D; &#x201C;5,&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1&#x201D;&#x005D;</a> (pp.
                    36&#x2013;37) was likewise torn out, although this leaf was reattached, using a
                    glued, perforated sticker (since the tear line fits the remaining stub, this
                    leaf was evidently not moved here from elsewhere). The gummed strip used to mend
                    this leaf&#x2014;resembling the border from a sheet of postage stamps&#x2014;resembles
                    one put to a similar use in proof sheets for <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFMS70" target="_blank" class="inactive">RF MS 70</a>). On this evidence,
                    one infers that <a href="../notes/collingwood_w_g_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> had a hand preserving MS I, an inference
                    coincident with his preparing the first bibliography of these manuscripts, the
                    &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:261&#x2013;67;

               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s erratic page numbering through p. 50 probably arose from
                    his attempt to correct earlier misnumbering. Erased earlier numbering remains
                    visible starting on the present p. 21 (&#x201C;19&#x201D; is the erased
                    number, an error since p. 19 had already appeared) and continuing consecutively
                    through p. 49&#x005B;<i>b</i>&#x005D; (i.e., the <i>second</i>
                    p. 49). Since the latter was written over top of &#x201C;47,&#x201D; it
                    appears that, at about this point, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> realized an error, went back to the
                    present p. 21, and began renumbering; however, he made some new errors and
                    possibly deliberately repeated pp. 48&#x2013;49 in an attempt to bring his
                    numbering in sync with following pages. The erratic numbering after p. 50
                    appears to have resulted from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writing &#x201C;80&#x201D; for
                    &#x201C;60,&#x201D; and carrying on without correction. The missing p. 87 is
                    probably a mere oversight.

                    wrote, &#x201C;this book begun about <span class="date-1826-09-1826-10">Sep<sup>t</sup> or Oct 1826</span> / finished about <span class="date-1827-01">Jan<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>&#x201D;
                    (see <a href="../apparatuses/mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Gloss on the Dating of MS I</a>). Since she inserted her annotation toward the
                    end, within the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>, 
                    it is probable that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> devoted approximately the <span class="date-1827-01">first month of 1827</span>
                    to fair&#x2010;copying the poems (and possibly also composing some of them), whereas
                    he had spent the <span class="date-1826-09-22-1826-12-31">fall/winter 1826</span> composing and fair&#x2010;copying 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, along with drawing its plates.
            </p>
            
            <p>Evidence for this sequence of events is supported by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s likely mimicry of
                    his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>&#x02BC;s form of dating MS I, when he dated a 1&#x2010;leaf presentation copy of 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/the_ship_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; <i>and</i> &#x201C;Look at That Ship&#x201D; &#x005B;1827&#x005D;</a> as
                    &#x201C;<span class="date-1827-02-1827-03"><span class="sic">febuary &#x005B;sic&#x005D;</span> or march 1827</span>,&#x201D; despite another hand, on
                    the reverse side, being confident in specifying the date as &#x201C;<span class="date-1827-02-16">16 Feb<sup>y</sup> 1827</span>&#x201D; 
                    (see <a href="../apparatuses/the_ship_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;The Ship&#x201D; <i>and</i> &#x201C;Look at That Ship&#x201D; &#x005B;1827&#x005D;: Date</a>). 
                    It can easily be imagined that, on this manuscript in <span class="date-1827-02-10-1827-02-20">mid-February 1827</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                    mimicked his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>&#x02BC;s manner from only a few weeks earlier of dating MS I.
            </p>
            
            <p><span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s annotation, depending on how one interprets it, possibly
                    suggests also that at least one of the poems, <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm,&#x201D;</a> was composed earlier than its
                    extant witness in MS I, while the rest of the poems may be dated no earlier than their
                    witnesses here (see <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Date</a>; and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;&#x005D;: Date</a>).
            </p>
            
            <p>Probably a few months after <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> entered her note dating the entire 
                    <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added 
                    <a href="../drawings/D1.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools&#x201D; &#x005B;Miscellaneous Drawing, MS I&#x005D;</a> 
                    to the back inside endboard and dated the drawing <span class="date-1827-03-21">21 March</span>, although no year is given. This appears to establish the
                    latest date of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s work on the manuscript.
            </p>
            
            <p>Thus, in summary, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably composed or at least fair&#x2010;copied the contents of the
                    manuscript <span class="date-1826-09-1827-03">between September 1826 and March 1827</span>, he may have composed some of
                    the contents earlier. In particular, <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</a> may date from <span class="date-1826-01-1826-04">early 1826</span>; and
                    <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, probably at least describes some events that occurred before <span class="date-1826-09-22-1826-12-21">fall 1826</span>,
                    if not actually drafted earlier. See the individual works for further discussion.

               <p>MS I is written entirely in large penciled print, more childish than that in any other
                    <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a>; nonetheless, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>
                    was already carefully imitating published books by justifying the margins;
                    devising a title page, frontispiece, and colophon; labeling his drawings as
                    &#x201C;plates&#x201D;; and filling out the volume with the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>, which he
                    entitled &#x201C;Poetry.&#x201D;

               <p>MS I shows more uniform control over the entirety of its contents than tended to
                    be the case in later <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Books</a>,
                    which grew more miscellaneous with successive uses at different times. For
                    example, the title page appears more nearly to serve for the entire manuscript than is the case in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a> and <a href="../apparatuses/msiiia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IIIA</a>, which likewise begin with volumes of
                    &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; but which also contain much else that is
                    altogether unrelated to the opening narrative.
               </p>
               
               <p>Similarly, the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>,
                    which fills out MS I, appears less haphazard than poetry miscellanies in the other Red Books. The first of
                    these poems, <a href="../apparatuses/the_steam_engine_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;&#x005D;</a>,
                    condenses a portion of <i>The Botanic Garden</i> by <a href="../notes/darwin_erasmus_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-ED">Erasmus Darwin</span></a>, thus
                    sustaining the <span class="date-1637-1815">Enlightenment</span>, entrepreneurial spirit of the immediately
                    preceding <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, which imitates works by associates of <span class="persName-ED">Erasmus Darwin</span>, 
                    <a href="../notes/edgeworth_maria_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-ME">Maria Edgeworth</span></a> and <a href="../notes/joyce_jeremiah_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</span></a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>As a visual artifact, MS I imitates the appearance of books <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have
                    known: he modeled the title page directly on <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Maria Edgeworth, <i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></a>; 
                    and in the &#x201C;plates,&#x201D; he imitated any
                    number of books in the Ruskin family library (<span class="persName-ME">Edgeworth</span>&#x02BC;s volumes were
                    not illustrated). Most of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;plates&#x201D; bear no
                    apparent relation with the text, but the frontispiece,
                    <a href="../drawings/D4.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Frontispiece&#x201D; &#x005B;Plate&#x005D; &#x201C;1&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; Vol 1&#x005D;</a>, 
                    which features &#x201C;a rainbow,&#x201D; may be
                    complemented by the last of the poems in the anthology, <a href="../apparatuses/on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;On the Rainbow: In Blank Verse.&#x201D;</a> The
                    rainbow drawing, moreover, could refer to Harry&#x02BC;s vision of the Witch of
                    the Alps at the end of <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could have added the rainbow to the
                    frontispiece as an afterthought: we cannot know for certain whether the textual
                    rainbow suggested the graphic one, or vice versa, or whether the two are
                    definitely related at all. But it seems likely that he arranged the contents in
                    order to frame the book with the theme of the rainbow as both promise and
                    closure.
               </p>
               
               <p>Another sign of control over the entirety of the contents appears at the end of
                    the Red Book, on p. 106, where <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> placed a colophon:
                    &#x201C;The end / <span class="placeName-HERNE">hernhill</span> / <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span> / <span class="del">end of the poems</span> / juvenile library <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span>.&#x201D; The
                    colophon is followed by <a href="../drawings/D1.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools&#x201D; &#x005B;Miscellaneous Drawing, MS I&#x005D;</a>, in
                    which the concave shape of the narrow valley appears to answer to the convex
                    form of the rainbow in the frontispiece. The colophon could be based on 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Maria Edgeworth, <i>Harry and Lucy Concluded</i></a>, which concludes in the fourth volume with
                    &#x201C;<span class="smallcaps">The End.</span>&#x201D; and, below that,
                    &#x201C;<span class="smallcaps"><span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>:</span> / <span class="smallcaps">Printed by <span class="persName-CW">Charles Wood</span>,</span> / <span class="placeName-POPPINSCT">Poppin&#x02BC;s Court</span>, <span class="placeName-FLEETST">Fleet Street</span>.&#x201D;
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> evidently meant the colophon to unify the entire contents of MS I&#x2014;<a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, 
                    along with the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>&#x2014;but the
                    deletion within the colophon of &#x201C;end of the poems&#x201D; points to how his
                    attempts at symmetry and closure were ongoing decisions. It appears that the deleted phrase originally formed part of a colophon that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant to apply only to the poetry anthology, 
                    but that, by deleting the phrase, he caused to refer to the entire Red Book, not just the
                    poems (reading, in effect, &#x201C;The end / <span class="placeName-HERNE">hernhill</span> / <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span> / juvenile library <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">fountain street</span>&#x201D;). Another, slightly different scenario is possible: the fact that the final two
                    poems of the anthology fall after <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s annotation dating the whole of
                    MS I may indicate that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> added these poems (on pp.
                    103&#x2013;6) after his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>&#x02BC;s dating, and as he did so, he deleted &#x201C;end of
                    the poems&#x201D; on p. 106 so as not to belie his addition. But this possibility seems contradicted by the placement of the colophon following all of the poems. 
                    It is also possible, of course, whatever the scenario, that the deletion was not made by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, but by someone
                    else.

               <p>MS I is the only <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a> to locate
                    its imaginary publisher, the &#x201C;juvenile library,&#x201D; in

                    Could <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> be referring to what <i>Praeterita</i> records as an early memory, the water
                    carts being filled in front of the house (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:21)?
                    In <i>Praeterita,</i> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> leaves unclear whether he observed
                    the carts from the windows of <span class="placeName-HERNE">Hern Hill</span> or of the <a href="../notes/hunter_street_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-HUNTERST">Hunter Street</span></a>
                    house&#x2014;where the family lived prior to <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, until <span class="date-1823-03">March 1823</span>
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINSCAMBERWELL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Dearden, <i>Ruskin&#x02BC;s Camberwell</i></a>, 1). By the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first wrote about this
                    memory in <span class="date-1871">1871</span> (in <i>Fors Clavigera</i> 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>,
                    27:169&#x005D;), he might well have confused memories of the two locations; or the
                    colophon itself might have suggested such a memory to him, when he doubtless
                    reviewed his juvenilia for those later autobiographical writings. Unfortunately,
                    attempts have been unsuccessful to gain information about either a <span class="placeName-FOUNTAINST">Fountain Street</span>
                    or water mains in the vicinities of the two houses.
