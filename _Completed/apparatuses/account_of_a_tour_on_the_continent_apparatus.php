            <p>In <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a>, 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> printed the title, 
                        Account of a Tour on the Continent, without square brackets, his symbol for declaring editorial intervention. 
                        Nonetheless, the title apparently originated with him, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> assigned no title to the 
                        sequence as a whole in any of the extant manuscripts 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1: 119, 281;

                        What titles <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> supplied apply only to individual verse 
                        and prose sections of the work. Accordingly, in <i>ERM</i>, 
                        when the main title is fully spelled out, it is given without quotation 
                        marks, in keeping with the guidelines given in <a href="../notes/title_citation_note.php" target="_blank">The System of Title Citation for Works</a>. 
                        In this apparatus, however, for convenience in the course of discussion, a short title is used with quotation marks (i.e., the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;) 
                        in order to avoid confusion with surrounding text.
            </p>
            
            <p>In another, more minor discrepancy respecting the editorial title, both

                        These editorial titles are as follows:

                        the selections were subsumed together under the title, &#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span> may originally have conceived the genre 
                        of the work as a travelogue solely in verse&#x2014;a version represented by a manuscript now bound in <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a>,

                        The work returned to this characterization as an all&#x2010;verse travelogue, when selections were excerpted and revised under the title,

                        (see <a href="#TITLE">Title</a>). By this time, however, the scenario of a 
                        &#x201C;Metrical Journal&#x201D; was imaginary, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had developed the work into a composite

                        <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a>, 
                        he was apparently aware of both of these manuscripts, although they had not yet been bound in <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a>. 
                        Among manuscripts currently extant, <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>, 
                        is the only known source of two poems, <a href="../showcase/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a>

                        includes both of these poems in his version of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                        His aquaintance with <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a> is equally probable, 
                        since he draws on what he calls the &#x201C;original&#x201D; draft of the poem, &#x201C;Calais,&#x201D; 
                        selecting lines that exist only in this version (see <span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/calais_poem_glosses#CALAISPOEMLINE2" target="_blank"" class="inactive">1</a></span>).

            <p><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> is inconsistent and seemingly arbitrary in 
                        his reliance on these &#x201C;originals,&#x201D; however. 
                        When printing what he calls the &#x201C;original draft&#x201D; of the poem &#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D; and the &#x201C;first draft&#x201D; of the poem &#x201C;St. Goar,&#x201D; 
                        his choice among variants shows that he adopted copytext from 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair copies in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>&#x2014;and

                        he chooses arbitrarily between lines of <a href="../showcase/calais_poem_msia_g1.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</a> as originally composed in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>

               <p>None of the manuscripts is dated by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Presumably, 
                            he began the work no earlier than the family&#x02BC;s departure for the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> shortly after

                            birthday, and it is possible that he began it no earlier than following

                            Neither of these possible termini a quo can be ruled out by the physical evidence of what is likely the earliest extant manuscript,

                            This manuscript, which is in the hands of both father and son, 
                            could even have been begun during the journey itself (see <a href="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p>If one argues a terminus a quo for <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, 
                            as the return home to <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, that date would be after 
                            , which was the day that the
                            family reached <span class="placeName-BOULOGNE">Boulogne</span>,
                            according to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s travel
                            diary (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFMS33A" target="_blank" class="inactive">Diary of John James Ruskin, 1833&#x2013;46</a>, p. 74). 
                            A few more days would have been required in order to transact 
                            business and cross the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span> at 
                            <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p>It is likely that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carried out 
                            the bulk of the composition and fair copying (especially the composite 
                            genre version) between <span class="date-1833-10">October 1833</span> and 
                            <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span>, the latest date when he could have delivered his contribution,

                            It is possible and even likely that, in order to devote his attention to these exciting commissions, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ceased steady work on his

                            some months earlier than the <span class="date-1834-08">August</span> deadline&#x2014;perhaps abandoning the fair copy in

               <p>Strong evidence in <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS VIII</a> shows that 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> labored on both draft and fair copy of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>,

                            Some very tenuous evidence exists that he extended work on the project until much later into the year, past <span class="date-1834-08">September 1834</span>: 
                            in the prose section of <a href="../showcase/brussels_prose_msix" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Brussels</a>&#x201D;, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            description of a distant view of the city resembles features in an engraved view of the subject 
                            based on a drawing by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, an engraving that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could not have seen prior to its publication 
                            in <span class="date-1834-09">September 1834</span> (see the gloss on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s description of the cathedral towers in

                            However, the similarity of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            and <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s prospects could be coincidental, 
                            whereas the evidence for dating the draft of the prose section of <a href="../showcase/brussels_prose_msix" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Brussels</a>&#x201D;, 
                            which is included in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a>, 
                            weighs heavily in favor of a date between <span class="date-1834-02">February</span> through <span class="date-1834-05">May 1834</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> probably started this <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft</a> 
                            for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x2014;draft consisting largely of poems relating to the Alpine and Italian stages of the tour, 
                            along with prose relating to the Belgian and German stages&#x2014;around the time of his <span class="date-1834-02-08">8 February 1834 birthday</span>.  
                            This important stint of draft can therefore be dated approximately between 
                            <span class="date-1834-02-08">8 February</span> and <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May</span>. 
                            The stint terminates with draft of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s ekphrastic and topographical poem, 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</a>, which was commissioned for

                            According to <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>, the latter poem dates from <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, 
                            so that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must have inserted its draft later on a blank page following the <span class="date-1834">1834</span> sequence; 
                            however, in <a href="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>, it is argued that the draft 
                            of <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</a> 
                            falls in a logical place in <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS VIII</a>, as belonging to <span class="date-1834">1834</span>. 
                            Its placement at the point where the

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> from the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; and he probably never returned to the project with sustained energy. 
                            No available evidence explains the timing of this commission relative to that for <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a> in the same volume

                            According to his story in the autobiography, <i>Praeterita</i>, it was the gift of this book for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            <span class="date-1832-02-08">1832 birthday</span> along with the family&#x02BC;s acquisition by subscription in

                            that prompted the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1833</a> 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35: 79; and see 
                            <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). 
                            The Ruskins did bring home <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s book in <span class="date-1833-04">April 1833</span>, but it is absurd to imagine that it 
                            sponsored <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s suggestion that the family &#x201C;should . . . go and see some of &#x005B;the wonderful places&#x005D; in reality,&#x201D; 
                            and that forthwith &#x201C;there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D; for such a journey. 
                            As <span class="persName-JDHUNT">John Dixon Hunt</span> points out, a letter by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            from <span class="date-1831-03-21">21 March 1831</span> indicates that the Ruskins had been planning their 
                            &#x201C;Switzerlandish outlandish tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>&#x201D; for at least two years 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35: 79; 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 286 n. 1, 253; and 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WIDERSEA" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hunt, <i>Wider Sea</i></a>).
               </p>
               
               <p>The more elusive date is when the Ruskins acquired the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of 
                            <i>Italy</i>. The question is of some interest, since it is argued in <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a> 
                            that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Account&#x201D; underwent a development similar to that of 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i>&#x2014;evolving from an all&#x2010;verse to a composite&#x2010;genre work. 
                            Unfortunately, the evidence is too contradictory to be able to align the family&#x02BC;s acquisition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition with 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s reworking of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; In the autobiography, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself admits that he has 
                            &#x201C;told this story so often&#x201D; about the influence of <span class="persName-SR">Roger</span>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition 
                            and its revelation of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s art, &#x201C;that I begin to doubt its time.&#x201D; 
                            In <i>Praeterita</i>&#x02BC;s typically dramatizing fashion, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> declares that 
                            &#x201C;the main tenor of my life&#x201D; was set on <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span> by the birthday gift from his father&#x02BC;s business partner, 
                            <a href="../notes/telford_henry_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Henry Telford (d. 1859)</a>. 
                            &#x201C;It is curiously tiresome that Mr. <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span> did not himself write my name in the book, 
                            and my father, who writes in it, &#x2018;The gift of <span class="persName-HT">Henry Telford</span>, Esq.,&#x2019;  
                            still more curiously, for him, puts no date: if it was a year later &#x005B;i.e., <span class="date-1833-02-08">8 February 1833</span>&#x005D;, no matter&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35: 79). 
                            In fact, the possible range is even wider. 
                            In a non&#x2010;illustrated edition, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem had been in the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> household 
                            since <span class="date-1828">1828</span> at the latest 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 188 n. 4). 
                            This happens to be the year when <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> published &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; of the poem; 
                            and growing disgusted over the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, he bought out remaining copies of both that volume and &#x201C;Part the First,&#x201D; and destroyed them 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> (1828)</a>; 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1823" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> (1823)</a>; 
                            and see <a href="../notes/samuel_rogers_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Samuel Rogers &#x005B;1763&#x2013;1855&#x005D;</a>). 
                            Thus, even before <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem achieved popularity in the illustrated edition, 
                            the Ruskins could count themselves among the select number of appreciative readers of the work in its original form, 
                            and it is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span> 
                            projected a work on this unillustrated verse model prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s receiving the gift of the illustrated version.
               </p>
               
               <p>When, then, did <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first see the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> version? 
                            It is possible that the gift did spur the family&#x02BC;s travel plans, but earlier than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remembered, 
                            since the first mention of Continental tour occurs in the letters the family letters for <span class="date-1831">1831</span>. 
                            His <span class="date-1831-02-08">1831 birthday</span> predates that first mention by only a month. 
                            An alternative, surprising possibility is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> owned the illustrated edition only after 
                            the family had returned from the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>. According to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s accounts, 
                            he purchased a copy of <i>Italy</i> 
                            in <span class="date-1833-10">October 1833</span>, just shortly after the <span class="date-1833-09">September</span> homecoming 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 286 n. 1). 
                            Could this explain why <span class="persName-HT">Telford</span>&#x02BC;s dedication is in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand? 
                            This <span class="date-1833-10">October 1833</span> purchase could well have been an additional copy of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> version 
                            that was already well loved by the family, 
                            and it seems unlikely that the Ruskins would have acquired this popular book so belatedly. Nonetheless, 
                            one cannot discount the possibility that <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s tutelage of the Ruskins&#x02BC; 
                            viewing of the <span class="placeName-ALPS">Alps</span> and <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> was, during the tour itself, solely poetic 
                            and based on earlier versions of the poem, 
                            whereas the ekphrastic influence of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> and <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> 
                            enhanced <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s perception at almost precisely the time when he developed an illustrated version of his own.

                            pursuing a distinct form of travelogue from what the work became.

                                The manuscript contains poems entitled <a href="../showcase/calais_poem_msia_g1.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</a>,

                                The father and son composed this version either during the <span class="date-1833-05-1833-09">May&#x2010;September 1833</span> journey itself, 
                                or following the family&#x02BC;s return home around <span class="date-1833-09-20">20 September</span> (see <a href="#DATE">Date</a>).

                  <li>In a second stage of composition, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> reconceptualized and elaborated the work as a composite&#x2010;genre 
                                rather than as a solely verse travelogue. This stage is epitomized in brief by a folded sheet, 
                                <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>, 
                                which like <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a> was later bound in

                                to come, <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a> contains a draft of the prose section,

                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> continued to develop the composite&#x2010;genre version in draft that occupies a significant portion of

                  <li>The <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft</a> includes verse, prose, and some rough drawings, 
                                supplying text for the fair copy of the composite&#x2010;genre version that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> must by this time have had underway in 
                                <a href="../apparatuses/msix_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>. This draft relates mainly to the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> journey, 
                                the sighting and crossing of the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, the tour in northern <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, 
                                and the tour of <span class="placeName-SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</span> 
                                (see <a href="APPARATUSTABLE1">Table 1</a> for complete contents). Near the beginning of this draft appear the prose sections for 
                                <a href="../showcase/andernacht_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</a> and

                                <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>. 
                                Thus, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> took up <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS VIII</a> 
                                to continue his draft (probably around the start of <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834</span>), 
                                he was catching up with composition of prose sections to match with poetry about places in <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> 
                                and <span class="geogName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, which he had already composed in the <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> 
                                &#x201C;Account&#x201D; manuscripts.

                                following the prose for <a href="../showcase/andernacht_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</a> and for <a href="../showcase/st_goar_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</a>, 
                                are those for <a href="../showcase/the_meuse_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</a>,

                                suggesting that by this point <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had fair&#x2010;copied the full composite sections of verse, prose, and drawing for 
                                &#x201C;Calais,&#x201D; &#x201C;Cassel,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Lille&#x201D; in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>.

                                (see <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php#LISTB1" target="_blank">MS VIII: Contents, section <i>b</i>, list <i>b</i>.1</a>).

                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mimicked the verse travelogues and prose landscape 
                                <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">annuals</a> of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                                which featured steel engravings after drawings by major landscape artists, and letterpress in verse or prose by writers 
                                who specialized in on&#x2010;demand travel writing, regardless of whether these writers had personally visited the places they described 
                                (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> organized the fair copy as composite groups, 
                                each typically consisting of a topographical poem about the place, a prose account of travel adventures, and related drawings, 
                                and each entitled according to major destinations along the course of the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey. 
                                In the drawings, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> either exactingly copied or imitated and adapted the manner of work by topographical and figure illustrators, 
                                which he knew from publications of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. His models included, most prominently, landscape vignettes by

                                But <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew on other graphic sources, as well, or invented his own scenes.

                  <li><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> failed to complete the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>, 
                                but he outlined its planned extension in a

                                which he outlined on the back endpapers of <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS VIII</a>. 
                                Several of these proposed additions are represented by poetry or prose 
                                sections that he had already drafted in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a>, 
                                and some illustrations proposed in the list may correspond to drawings that form a brief gallery of Alpine scenes 
                                pasted onto otherwise blank pages at the end of the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>. 
                                Draft writing and drawings for this proposed extension of the fair copy may have been lost, but much of the ambitious plan probably was never executed. 
                                A few other fugitive pieces of writing, probably intended for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; and fair&#x2010;copied in hands other than <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s,

                                Since this draft occurs shortly prior to and overlaps with draft of poetry for his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May 1834</span> birthday, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> perhaps began compiling his list of proposed contents in <span class="date-1834-03-01-1834-04-30">March or April 1834</span>. 
                                The fair copy in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a> breaks off in the middle of the section on 
                                <span class="placeName-HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</span>, suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> ceased fair&#x2010;copying 
                                at about the same time that he stopped drafting in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a> and developed the projected list of contents. 
                                However, as indicated by a list for projected development of the project, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not so much abandon the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; 
                                as put the work on hold&#x2014;and the reason was not the distraction of a family tour following his 
                                <span class="persName-JJR">father</span>&#x02BC;s birthday, but a new major project. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> segued his achievement 
                                in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; into an exciting commmission for the engraved gift annual,

                                Drawing directly on the text of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; he revised the poems

                                Even more auspiciously, for the same volume of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>, 
                                he drew on his self&#x2010;instruction in the materiality of illustrated travel publications of the

                                As one reason for selecting this poem from among the unpublished verse for &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                the editors may have meant to repair a rift caused by the omission of this poem from <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a>, 
                                since, in the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                the poems &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; and &#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D; form a connected trio.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Almost six decades after <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                two versions of the work were edited for publication. One version, 
                                prepared by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> 
                                for <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a>, 
                                consisted solely of verse extracts, in keeping with the parameters of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s anthology. 
                                A second version, edited by <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> and 
                                <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> for the second volume (<span class="date-1903">1903</span>) of the 
                                <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a>, 
                                used <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s version as a base text, 
                                but folded in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s complementary prose sections 
                                from <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a> along with some additional verse 
                                that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had neglected in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a>.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Both of these edited versions used the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a> fair copy as main copytext, 
                                supplemented by draft from <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a> in order to represent the full scope of the 
                                <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour. Both versions also preferred <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s revised texts of 
                                <a href="../showcase/andernacht_poem_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</a> and 
                                <a href="../showcase/st_goar_poem_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</a> 
                                as published in <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 
                                although printing those poems&#x02BC; earlier versions in the notes. 
                                <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>&#x02BC;s version was the first to reproduce a page 
                                from <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a> exemplifying <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s integration of text and picture. 
                                <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s edition reproduced sketches that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made during the actual tour (these also reprinted in the Library Edition version). 
                                Thus, the Library Edition edition version comes closest to realizing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions 
                                for the composite&#x2010;genre version of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; considered as a reflection of illustrated travelogues of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, 
                                whereas <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s version seems constructed as a biographical souvenir of the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour. 
                                <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> did not justify his editorial procedures for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; and he is unlikely to have derived textual authority 
                                for an all&#x2010;verse version from <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, 
                                which he appears not to have known (see gloss, line 2, <a href="../showcase/calais_poem_1891.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</a>). 
                                In light of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s dismissive remarks about the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in chapter 4 (<span class="date-1885">1885</span>) of the autobiography, <i>Praeterita</i>, 
                                it is unlikely that the now elderly <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> contributed to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s editing, 
                                except by indirectly encouraging the biographical approach that underpins <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s procedure&#x2014;and 
                                even in this respect, the editor elaborated his own story about the Ruskins&#x02BC; <span class="date-1833">1833</span> Continental tour, 
                                as presented in his <span class="date-1894">1894</span> biography, <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Life and Work of John Ruskin</i></a>

               <p>This overview is substantiated by detailed analysis in <a href="#DRAFT">Draft</a>,

                            For ease of reference, the analysis is supported by tables, which 
                            organize information about the contents of the respective manuscripts.

                                the columns list vertically the separate verse and prose sections and illustrations of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                as they appear sequentially in the manuscripts or parts of manuscripts containing the work. 
                                Horizontally, the columns represent a rough chronological order, from the conjecturally earliest to the latest of the manuscripts, 
                                ending with the versions of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; edited for publication; however, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> likely worked on more than one of these manuscripts simultaneously&#x2014;especially, 
                                on the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>, 
                                alongside the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft</a>&#x2014;and 
                                so the sequence of composition, section by section, cannot be recovered in very specific detail. 
                                Nonetheless, in a broad view, the table represents <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s developing intentions. 
                                This table also provides information about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s system of line numbering, 
                                which he attached to the verse sections of some manuscripts, 
                                and which may provide clues about the sequence of composition.

                  <li><a href="APPARATUSTABLE2">Table 2</a> organizes information about the contents of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; 
                                from the perspective of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s final version, as he partly realized his vision in the fair copy,

                                and as he prospectively outlined the work&#x02BC;s planned completion in the

                                To the right of this first vertical column, additional columns indicate where drafts or fair copies of these respective prose or verse sections 
                                or illustrations can be located in surviving manuscripts or published versions. In other words, 
                                this table provides a checklist for the location of draft, fair copy, and publication of individual sections of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                                The table makes note of editorial interventions in titles.

               <p>The larger hypothesis advanced here concerning the composition of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            developed the work in stages, from a verse travelogue in the eighteenth&#x2010;century topographical manner&#x2014;as 
                            represented by <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, 
                            a collaboration with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x2014;to a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated travelogue that reflected the material culture 
                            surrounding the ekphrastic and travel&#x2010;related publishing of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                            In so doing, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> worked toward invention of the persona, &#x201C;J.R.,&#x201D; who signed the culminating publication of the project, <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a>, 
                            published in the fashionable <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">literary annual</a>, 
                            <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</i>. 
                            With the project of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; founded in a poetic collaboration with his father, 
                            and elaborated in response to his surrounding material culture of ekphrastic and topographical publication, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s devising of his first literary persona represents the work of both the youth himself and his editors and literary mentors. 
                            Traces of editorial intervention can be encountered only sporadically in the manuscript record, however, 
                            and evidence about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s interaction with the editor,

                                The case for this manuscript as the earliest extant surviving draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is based on the fact that its markup for revision 
                                (e.g., deletions, substitutions, transposition of lines) is incorporated into the 
                                <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>, 
                                and on the assumption that this group of poems about the Ruskins&#x02BC; first leg of their Continental journey, 
                                from <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> to <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> and along the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse River</span>, 
                                formed a logical compositional starting point for the work.

                                additional research. It is at least evident that the father and son collaborated to some significant degree in the production of this material witness, 
                                and that the text is characteristic more of the Augustan verse travelogues that prevailed in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s youth 
                                than of the Byronic or Dickensian manner of travel narration that marked <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s first decade as an author

                                In effect, this sequence of five poems stands vis&#x2010;à&#x2010;vis the composite&#x2010;genre

                                similarly to how the earlier published texts of 
                                <a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</a>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i>

                  <p>One might argue that <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, 
                                does not witness a distinct version of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project, one conceived as travelogue solely in verse, 
                                but rather draft that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended to incorporate directly into the composite&#x2010;genre 
                                <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>. 
                                That hypothesis cannot be disproven; however, evidence weighs more heavily in favor of this manuscript as representing a distinct stage of the work, 
                                in that no other draft manuscript of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; consists solely of verse, and in that this manuscript physically suggests 
                                what was originally meant as a self&#x2010;standing fair copy, which was later subjected to revision. 
                                In arrangement of lines on the manuscript, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s large, eighteenth&#x2010;century hand required the full width of sheet 1, 
                                and <span class="persName-JR">John</span> sustained his father&#x02BC;s column in narrower scope and a smaller hand; however, on the verso of sheet 2, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">John</span> stacked the lines in double columns, as if imitating a printed copy. 
                                (He inserted the final poem in the sequence, <a href="../showcase/the_meuse_poem_msia_g1.php">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</a>, 
                                sideways in space remaining on the recto of sheet 2, rather than starting a third sheet, 
                                further substantiating the sense of the manuscript as a self&#x2010;contained entity.) The few substitutions&#x2014;all 
                                apparently in <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s hand, but not certainly so, especially in the case of overwriting&#x2014;are largely made as strikethroughs, 
                                with insertions above or below the line, and never as in&#x2010;line revisions, 
                                suggesting that these changes formed a distinct stage of this manuscript&#x02BC;s development, following its original purpose as a fair copy. 
                                Moreover, in the margins of both sheets, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the lines of the poems sequentially and continuously (1&#x2013;173); 
                                that is, he did not begin his line numbering anew with each poem, suggesting that he regarded the poems as forming a sequence

                                This manuscript differs in size and appearance from 
                                <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, and it contains a prose section,

                                Unlike <i>g</i>.1, this manuscript was rough draft from inception, with many in&#x2010;line revisions. 
                                Its place in the evolution of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; appears to be a transitional one between the all&#x2010;verse and the composite&#x2010;genre versions, 
                                since it contains not only both prose and verse but also a selection of sections that seems strategic, although the exact purpose of the selection is obscure. 
                                The manuscript begins with draft of the first prose section of the 
                                <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> 
                                (which incorporates the changes made to the draft), but the prose is followed by drafts of poems that, 
                                in topographical terms of the actual tour, skip far ahead of the family&#x02BC;s landing at <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, as if presenting highlights of the tour.

                  <p>The destinations represented by the draft poems are widely spaced but not random. 
                                The manuscript&#x02BC;s four poems form two pairs, one pair consisting of two nearly adjacent Italian destinations, 
                                <a href="../showcase/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> and

                                and the second pair consisting of two adjacent destinations along the <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span>, 
                                <a href="../showcase/andernacht_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</a> and

                                (the family actually journeyed down the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span> to the <span class="geogName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span>, and then crossed the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span> and descended to the Italian lakes and <span class="placeName-MILAN">Milan</span>), 
                                the arrangement suggests an abstract of the scope of the composite&#x2010;genre version.

                                before he broke off in the middle of the section on &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D; (although even that trio of sections in MS IX shows gaps for illustrations,

                                had used for rough copy of poetry and since <span class="date-1831">1831</span>, and that he would continue to use for drafting imaginative work

                                This sequence is logical, given that the family departed on the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1833</a>

                                does represent the most significant development of the composite&#x2010;genre version to survive in draft, but <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was not aware that

                                he had already drafted the earlier prose sections for the &#x201C;Calais,&#x201D; &#x201C;Cassel,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Lille&#x201D; sections, and transferred the draft to

                                accords well with the trajectory of this writing toward a terminus ad quem among draft of poetry celebrating his father&#x02BC;s 
                                <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May 1834</span> birthday; and this date of commencement also seems well situated to account for the progress he was likely to have made on the

                                Although the prose sections on <a href="../showcase/andernacht_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</a> and

                                approximately two&#x2010;thirds of the way into the work as fair&#x2010;copied), since he had yet to compose at least two prose accounts belonging

                                The logical inference is that, by <span class="date-1834-02-13-1834-02-28">the middle to late February 1834</span>,

                                for the work&#x02BC;s continuation, and not as an overview from start to finish. As such, we can conceive of him planning the continuation 
                                either as he began fair&#x2010;copying the sections on &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; and on &#x201C;St. Goar,&#x201D; 
                                which are the last completed sections to be fair&#x2010;copied in

                                having just started the section on &#x201C;Heidelberg.&#x201D; There is no way to tell whether <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> compiled the table all at once or developed it over time.

                                    unprecedented in its scale&#x2014;of a scene from Prout&#x02BC;s <i>Facsimiles</i> occupies the following page (p.

                                    been intended here. Just so, the verso following p.
                                    ??? containing the broadside (i.e., p.
                                    ???) is blank, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have intended nothing here, just as the

                                    error. A drawing fitting that description appears instead on p. ???,

                                    presence of a drawing. It appears, therefore, that the editors
                                    simply misplaced their note on this drawing&#x2014;unless at some
                                    point following their description, the slip with the drawing became

                            along the family&#x02BC;s tour. Each unit typically consists of a poem in the picturesque mode, followed by a prose piece in a comic or anecdotal mode, 
                            and with the writing encased in illustrations mimicking the appearance of engravings or lithographs, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew on separate slips and pasted into place. 
                            He modeled the layout on the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of the topographical poem, <i>Italy</i>, 
                            by <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>, an edition illustrated by engraved vignettes after drawings primarily 
                            by <span class="persName-JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</span> for landscapes, and by <span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span> for figures, 
                            and also including minor illustrations by <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span> and others. 
                            In his own illustrations, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> imitates the appearance of these steel engravings, 
                            in some cases adopting <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s manner for landscapes and <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s for figures, according to his purposes in the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also imitates <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span>&#x02BC;s style of architectural drawing along with the watery appearance of lithography, 
                            a new medium that he discovered in <span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1833">1833</span> <i>Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</i>. 
                            The text is lettered in a careful copperplate&#x2010;style hand, justified left and right.

               <p>As argued in <a href="#DRAFTMSVIII">Draft: MS VIII</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> started the 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> no later than <span class="date-1834-01">January 1834</span>, 
                            and perhaps earlier, sometime during the <span class="date-1834-10-1834-12">final quarter of 1833</span>&#x2014;earlier, in any case, 
                            than <span class="date-1834-02">February 1834</span>, when he started on the 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in MS VIII</a>. As he 
                            worked on that draft from <span class="date-1834-02-1834-04">February through April</span>, leading up to his father&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1834-05-10">10 May 1834</span> birthday, 
                            and possibly somewhat beyond that date, the content of the draft gradually converged with the pace of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying in MS IX. 
                            While the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</a> 
                            contains much that he never fair&#x2010;copied, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> apparently came to a point when he was almost simultaneously drafting the section of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; 
                            that he was in process of fair&#x2010;copying. He had arrived at that point, when he broke off work altogether on the 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>This break occurred when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had completed fair&#x2010;copying the poem, <a href="../showcase/heidelberg_poem_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</a>, 
                            and had started fair&#x2010;copying the first few lines of the corresponding prose section, <a href="../showcase/heidelberg_prose_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</a>. 
                            The draft of this prose piece occurs intermittently in the section of MS VIII that mingles draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; with droft of birthday poems for <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                            (<a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php#LISTB2" target="_blank">MS VIII: Contents, <i>b</i>.2</a>;

                            Just so, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s draft of the poem, <a href="../showcase/heidelberg_poem_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</a>, 
                            the last of the <i>completed</i> fair&#x2010;copied texts in MS IX, 
                            occurs intermittently toward the end of the section of of MS VIII that is devoted solely to draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; 
                            (i.e., preceding the section that mingles draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; with poetry in the making for <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s birthday,

                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was also composing the poem, <a href="../showcase/ehrenbreitstein_poem_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</a>, 
                            along with the poem, <a href="../showcase/heidelberg_poem_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</a>, 
                            indicating that at that point he was readying materials for fair&#x2010;copying the trio of sections that precede the &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201C; section&#x2014;&#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; and &#x201C;St. Goar.&#x201D;
               </p>
               
               <p>The cause of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s abruptly ceasing fair&#x2010;copying in MS IX is readily evident in the
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</a>, in which 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php#LISTB2" target="_blank">MS VIII: Contents, <i>b</i>.2</a> runs up against draft for

                            as segue the project into his first professional publications, the poems for

               </p>
               
               <p>Several blank spaces in the manuscript mark places for drawings, and one cannot determine the difference between a gap where a drawing has gone missing 
                            and one that never held anything. In <span class="date-1885">1885</span>, commenting on the manuscript in <i>Praeterita</i>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> said both reasons were accountable 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:81). Moreover, 
                            there appears no way of knowing whether more drawings were lost (or restored) between <span class="date-1885-1903">1885 and 1903</span>, 
                            when <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> described the manuscript for the Library Edition.
               </p>
               
               <p>Folowing the recto (48r) containing the prose fragment for <a href="../showcase/heidelberg_prose_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;</a>, 
                            no more text appears for the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>, 
                            but on the following 7 rectos (49r&#x2013;55r) are pasted the 8 drawings described in 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:364 n. 1. 
                            All of these drawings depict mountain scenes. The blank versos facing each of these 7 pages would not have been adequate 
                            to contain verse and/or prose of the length exhibited in earlier sections. It appears, therefore, 
                            that someone used these blank rectos following the cessation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair copying as a space to exhibit a gallery of vignettes, 
                            without the expectation that intervening text would ever be fair&#x2010;copied, 
                            even though draft for text exists in MS VIII relating to these kinds of mountain scenes&#x2014;and must have existed in the

                                In fact, the draft is placed sequentially and chronologically, immediately following the abandoned draft of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D;

                                for delivering the completed volume of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> to the printer

                  <p>This timetable also accords well with a <span class="date-1834-03-10">10 March 1834</span> verse epistle by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to his father,

                                which is remarkable for <i>not</i> mentioning the <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> commissions. 
                                In this rhymed letter, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drops the idea of sending some observations on natural history to the editor, 
                                <a href="../notes/loudon_j_c_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">John Claudius Loudon (1783&#x2013;1843)</a>, 
                                to be considered for publication in the <i>Magazine of Natural History</i>, so it seems surprising that 
                                he would have failed to add a couplet or two celebrating his submissions to another editor, <span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span> 
                                (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 285). 
                                It seems more likely that, at this time, no arrangements had as yet been made with <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x2014;or that, 
                                if <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had approached the editor, <span class="persName-JR">John</span> as yet knew nothing about an impending professional debut as a poet. As recently as <span class="date-1834-01-22">22 January 1834</span>, 
                                <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> had written to <span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> for advice about cultivating <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s poetic talents (pointing to the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as an example), but 
                                expressing misgivings about exposing his son to the public as a prodigy. This letter&#x2014;in which <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> renewed contact with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> abruptly, and following a long hiatus 
                                in the family&#x02BC;s slight relationship with the famed Scottish writer&#x2014;suggests that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was already contemplating publication of <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s poetry, 
                                but the letter also reveals the caution with which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s parents treated such a momentous possibility. 
                                Notably, the letter mentions no specific plans having been hatched with <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>, who was a longtime friend of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s 
                                (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <i>Memorials of James Hogg</i></a>, 273&#x2013;75;

                  <p><span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was sent a sampling of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s verse (possibly a selection from the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;), 
                                to which he responded with a critique (seconded by his children&#x02BC;s tutor) that does not survive, 
                                but that <span class="persName-JR">John</span> characterized as treating him with lenience while laying stress on the derivativeness of his verse. 
                                When <span class="persName-JR">John</span> replied gratefully to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> on <span class="date-1834-02-13">13 February 1834</span>, 
                                he had received an invitation to visit the <span class="persName-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span> on his farm in Scotland (which <span class="persName-JR">John</span> declined), 
                                but he apparently had received no direct encouragement to publish 
                                (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <i>Memorials of James Hogg</i></a>, 276&#x2013;77). 
                                One can only speculate whether <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> had a hand subsequently in prompting his friends&#x2014;the 
                                editor, <span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span>, and the publisher, <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span>&#x2014;to consider <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as a contributor to <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>, 
                                a publication that had benefited by <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s own contributions. (The prompting may have worked in the opposite direction, with <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> encouraging <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                                to apply to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> for advice.) One can only speculate, further, whether <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s introduction of the prodigy to <span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span>&#x2014;which 
                                may have occurred at this time, but concerning which no contemporary evidence is known&#x2014;had any bearing on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s public appearance as &#x201C;J.R.&#x201D; 
                                Respecting the parallel case about which we do have evidence&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s proposal to submit a nonpoetic contribution to <span class="persName-JCL">J. C. Loudon</span>&#x02BC;s 
                                <i>Magazine of Natural History</i>&#x2014;two important facts emerge: that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> considered <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>, another Scot, to be a &#x201C;friend,&#x201D; 
                                and that the boy had the confidence to propose the submission himself

                                That prejudice remained influential as late as <span class="date-1891">1891</span>, when <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> 
                                published only verse selections in the first attempt to edit the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a comprehensive tour poem.

                                and aware also of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s extensive work on the project dispersed among several manuscripts 
                                (he identified MS VII, MS VIII, MS IX, and MS XI, but not MS IA &#x005B;see <a href="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</a>&#x005D;), 
                                <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> nonetheless edited the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as if it were strictly the &#x201C;Metrical Journal&#x201D; of the &#x201C;Fragments.&#x201D; 
                                He was limited by the parameters of his edition, which in turn obeyed the special status that the

                                By the <span class="date-1890-1899">1890s</span>, moreover, the privately printed and distributed <span class="date-1850">1850</span> edition of the <i>Poems</i> had taken on a talismanic aura for rare book collectors, 
                                and <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> inevitably justified the purposes of the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> edition in part by appealing to the &#x201C;no idle curiosity . . .  that prompts the admirers 
                                of Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s works to collect his boyish writings and to learn the story of his youth.&#x201D; It was in &#x201C;these poems,&#x201D; it was believed, 
                                &#x201C;although he thrust them aside for prose,&#x201D; that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> &#x201C;could better put the complicated feelings, thoughts, and facts which he had to tell,&#x201D; 
                                and which therefore constituted &#x201C;the best introduction to his later and greater books&#x201D;

                                of whose &#x201C;full account of the published poems&#x201D; in the

                     <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> &#x201C;gladly availed&#x201D; himself (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>,

                                1:268). <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was therefore to some degree influenced by <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span>&#x02BC;s manipulation of the bibliographical record in favor of juvenile poems 
                                that <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span> could forge in the form of &#x201C;rare&#x201D; pamphlets (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WISERUSKINI" target="_blank" class="inactive">Dearden, &#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I&#x201D;</a>, 46&#x2013;47;

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The tendency to think of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a verse travelogue gained impetus from the elder <span class="persName-JJR">Ruskin</span> himself, 
                                who in <i>Praeterita</i> characterized it as &#x201C;a rhymed history of the tour&#x201D; and a &#x201C;poetical account of our tour, 
                                in imitation of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i>&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:81). 
                                <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> quotes this characterization in his description of <a href="../apparatuses/apparatus_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>, 
                                thus implicitly pointing to some authority for presenting the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a verse travelogue. He realized, however, that in the manuscripts available to him, 
                                the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; consisted of both &#x201C;prose and verse&#x201D;; and if pressed, since he had no knowledge of the all&#x2010;verse version in 
                                <a href="../apparatuses/msia_g1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, he would have acknowledged that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own later understanding 
                                of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; was tendentious: in boyhood, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> &#x201C;had intended this volume &#x005B;<a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">the MS IX fair copy</a>&#x005D; 
                                to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings! . . . I am pretty certain that . . . &#x005B;when writing <i>Praeterita</i>, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x005D; was not aware of the amount of material existing in rough copies at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves,&#x201D; 
                                referring to MS VII, MS VIII, and MS XI 
                                (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 
                                1:265; and <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;8<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 
                                1:267). Whether <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> would have included prose selections from the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in the volume of prose that he projected as a companion to the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> <i>Poems</i> is unknown.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>What engaged <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> about the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; was less its genre than its biographical record of the family tour. 
                                He prefaces his edition of the work with a passage from <i>Praeterita</i> in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> describes the family setting out on the 
                                <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1833</a>

                                and he was interested in the materials &#x201C;existing in rough copies at the back of . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s&#x005D; book&#x2010;shelves,&#x201D; 
                                because the trove afforded him verse to fill out the topographical sequence to the full extent of the family&#x02BC;s tour. 
                                Where these materials lacked titles, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> provided identifying place&#x2010;names 
                                (see <a href="#TITLE">Title</a>), sometimes on slender evidence, in order to situate poems in a topographical order. 
                                From the same motive, apparently, he reproduced only drawings that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made during the tour itself, 
                                instead of illustrating his edition with the phenomenal <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">the MS IX fair copy</a>. 
                                <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> reproduces &#x201C;Watch&#x2010;tower at Andernach (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>),&#x201D; 
                                which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> drew in the manner of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>;

                                in their notes documenting placement of drawings, although at least one of these notes is muddled.)

                                in addition to the main copytexts drawn from <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a>, 
                                he supplied the MS IX versions in notes. Even in these texts, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> regularized punctuation and spelling, and of course he felt free to so in publishing 
                                texts for which only rough draft was available.

                            of sections of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; or his sequence of composition is the line numbering, which runs throughout verse portions of the work in

                            The numbering is listed in <a href="APPARATUSTABLE1">Table 1</a>.

               <p>In the two sheets comprising <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>, 
                            the lines of the five poems are numbered continuously, 1&#x2013;173, without breaks between the separate poems. 
                            In <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>, 
                            the line numbering begins following the prose section for <a href="../showcase/calais_prose_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</a>, 
                            starting with the first line of <a href="../showcase/passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</a> as line no. 360, 
                            and running continuously from poem to poem, to line no. 429. Since the poems in this manuscript could never have been conceived as sequentially ordered 
                            in a topographical sense for fair copy, this instance shows that the line count was valuable to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in some way, but not necessarily in a way that 
                            can be lined up directly against the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>.
               </p>
               
               <p>In the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft sequence</a>, 
                            the line numbering takes up with line no. 506, applied to the mysterious poem, 
                            <a href="../showcase/oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</a>; 
                            and the numbering carries relentlessly and mechanically forward through the verse draft in 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/ms_viii_apparatus.php#CONTENTS" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII: Contents, Section <i>b</i></a>. 
                            As in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.2</a>, 
                            the line numbering in the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft sequence</a> 
                            bears no relation to the topographical sequence of sections, since these are jumbled. 
                            Here, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is mechanically numbering lines of poetry, for whatever use he made of the information.
               </p>
               
               <p>Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s purpose in the numbering the lines of poetry is not obvious. 
                            Doubtless, he needed a count in order to estimate space needed to fair&#x2010;copy lines; however, the system would not have helped him estimate space for prose, 
                            and the presence of the numbering in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a> 
                            suggests that he initiated the numbering scheme before he even conceived the plan for the fair copy. 
                            Whatever its function, the mechanical quality of the numbering, along with the lack of any appearance of its having been added at a later time, 
                            tends to reinforce the evidence that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in a straightforward sequence, 
                            as suggested by the regular, uncrowded appearance of the manuscripts&#x2014;despite the helter&#x2010;skelter leaping around the map in topographical subjects.
               </p>
               
               <p>In the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII draft sequence</a>, 
                            there may exist minor, localized confusions in sequence of composition, 
                            which are concealed by the apparently straightforward line numbering. For example, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            started the prose section for <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> on 62r, 
                            three&#x2010;quarters of the way down the page, and entitled it 
                            <a href="../showcase/part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</a>. 
                            This draft extends halfway through 62v, where it stops in mid&#x2010;sentence (&#x201C;. . . circumnavigating,&#x201D; 
                            substituted for <span class="del">traversing</span>), followed by a poem, 
                            <a href="../showcase/oh_softly_blew_the_mounting_breeze_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D;</a> 
                            (entitled <a href="../showcase/chiavenna_poem_1891.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Chiavenna&#x201D;</a> in <i>Poems</i> (<span class="date-1891">1891</span>) 
                            and in the <a href="../showcase/chiavenna_poem_le.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition version</a>). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> numbered the poem&#x02BC;s lines 810&#x2013;22, 
                            which is continuous with a previous installment of verse (lines 778&#x2013;809), for a quite different poem, 
                            <a href="../showcase/oh_the_morn_looked_bright_over_hill_and_dale_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Oh the morn looked bright over hill and dale&#x201D; &#x005B;&#x201C;The Black Forest&#x201D;&#x005D;&#x201D;</a>). 
                            The remainder of the prose passage on <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span>, 
                            <a href="../showcase/part_of_brussels_prose2_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</a> 
                            (taken up in mid&#x2010;line, &#x201C;perambulating . . . tread on it softly&#x201D;) begins at the top of the next recto, 63r, 
                            and it is completed on 63v.
               </p>
               
               <p>One inference is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrapped the prose around the poem, 
                            already drafted in its place, on 62v. It is equally possible, however, that the sequence of composition was what it appears to be, 
                            but that the abrupt shifts between prose and poetry provide a clue about the process of fair&#x2010;copying 
                            (provided that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had begun work in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a> by this point). 
                            In the fair copy of this prose passage for <a href="../showcase/brussels_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</a>, 
                            a line of text ends with the break&#x2010;point in the draft, &#x201C;circumnavigating for&#x201D;&#x2014;with 
                            the &#x201C;for&#x201D; jammed against the justified right margin. The next line resumes with &#x201C;perambulating.&#x2014;Oh woe to the weather&#x201D; etc. 
                            One might infer, then, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fair&#x2010;copied 
                            <a href="../showcase/part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 1&#x005D;</a> in 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> as far as he had drafted the prose in MS VIII (62v); 
                            crossed out the last word in MS VIII draft on 62v (<span class="del">traversing</span>), since he could not fit it on the line in the 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> 
                            (hence, the tightly fitted, almost run&#x2010;together &#x201C;circumnavigating, for&#x201D;); 
                            then stopped fair&#x2010;copying the prose in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>, 
                            in order to draft the poem that falls next in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a>, 
                            <a href="../showcase/oh_softly_blew_the_mounting_breeze_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D;</a> 
                            (and numbered its lines accurately in sequence); and finally resumed drafting prose with 
                            <a href="../showcase/part_of_brussels_prose2_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; &#x005B;part 2&#x005D;</a>, 
                            but changed his mind about the next word (making it &#x201C;perambulating,&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;traversing&#x201D;).
               </p>
               
               <p>In this case, either scenario is supported by the evidence of the line numbering and the appearance of the draft. 
                            One conclusion that might be drawn from both scenarios is that fair&#x2010;copying was as important to 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as composition. Another inference is the unsettledness of his imagination, 
                            which could danced so mercurially from prose to verse, from the memory of <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> 
                            to evoking the <span class="placeName-BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p>A hazard of interpreting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s line numbering in 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII</a> is that it can lead to ambiguity about what verse 
                            he intended for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project. Following the <span class="date-1833-05">May 1833</span> birthday ode for his father, 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday: The Month of May&#x201D;</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first applied the numbering (line no. 506) to 
                            <a href="../showcase/oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</a>, 
                            a poem that he did not fair&#x2010;copy in <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX</a>, 
                            and that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> as well as 
                            <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> hesitated to identify as part of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> separated the poem from the preceding birthday ode by a horizontal line&#x2014;a 
                            designation used throughout <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS VIII</a> to divide one work from another&#x2014;but 
                            he supplied no title for the new piece in particular or for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in general, 
                            which would have helpfully signaled where the draft for the topographical work begins. 
                            The sole clue that the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; draft begins with this poem is its line numbering, 
                            which is not attached to the preceding <span class="date-1831">1831</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1833">33</span> poetry in 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/ms_viii_apparatus.php#CONTENTS" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VIII: Contents, Section <i>a</i></a>, 
                            but that does run throughout the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; draft. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
                            one must assume that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended 
                            <a href="../showcase/oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</a> 
                            for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; despite the difficulty of situating the poem in the fair copy. 
                            (And one must understand the poem&#x02BC;s reference to spiritual presences, rather than to visible topography, 
                            as a significant aspect of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s thinking about his first journey abroad&#x2014;particularly 
                            the mountain scenery that may form the context of this lyric, with <a href="../showcase/source_of_the_arveron_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</a> 
                            falling next in sequence, which likewise evokes spiritual presences.
               </p>
               
               <p>This discussion is provided as a demonstration of how <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s line numbering might be used as evidence in establishing the contents and development of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            Use of this evidence always calls for caution, since the evidence is ambiguous in itself, and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was sometimes inconsistent in how he applied the numbering. 
                            In <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php#LISTB2" target="_blank">MS VIII: Contents, <i>b</i>.2</a>, 
                            he extended the numbering system from draft poetry for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; into verse that clearly does not belong to the project,

               <p>In the broadest view, the publishing history of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; up to <span class="date-1903">1903</span> (see <a href="#PUBLICATION"></a>) 
                            might be viewed as a gradual recovery and conjectural reconstruction of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s final intentions for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x2014;a steady editorial advance toward realizing 
                            his elaborately composite&#x2010;genre, albeit uncompleted <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair&#x2010;copy version</a>. 
                            From the publication in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> and <span class="date-1850">1850</span> by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earliest editors, along with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s oversight, of &#x201C;fragments&#x201D; from a putative &#x201C;metrical journal,&#x201D; 
                            to the reconstruction in <span class="date-1891">1891</span> by <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> of a solely metrical journal that traced the full itinerary 
                            of the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> journey, to the restoration in <span class="date-1903">1903</span> by <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Alexander Wedderburn</span> of prose pieces and drawings to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s fuller metrical version&#x2014;each 
                            step in this history might be read teleologically as advancing toward realizing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s final vision for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; by steadily accruing more of its parts. 
                            The Library Edition version crowns this editorial trend by attempting to represent most comprehensively not only the portion of the project that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            fair&#x2010;copied and illustrated in the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX version</a> but also the continuation 
                            of the project that he planned to form a greater whole in his

                            and that he partly drafted in MS VII, MS VIII, and MS XI.
               </p>
               
               <p>To see the editorial history as a steady advancement and simple expansion toward a single ideal text would imply, however, 
                            that each of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s editors projected the same ideal text. While all of these editors did presumably have access to sufficient evidence 
                            of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s largest ambitions for the project&#x2014;his composite&#x2010;genre version&#x2014;their respective treatments suggest conflicting views about a preferred ideal text. 
                            The question is complicated by the varying constraints of their publication venues (<i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>, 
                            as an <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">annual</a>, was meant to anthologize only brief lyric poems or tales, 
                            whereas the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> aimed at unprecedented completeness in collecting 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s works), but this external factor does not entirely determine the editors&#x02BC; differing ideas about how to represent the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project 
                            most effectively or&#x2014;what was for the earlier editors inseparable from representation of the text&#x2014;their influence over <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s developing idea of authorship.
               </p>
               
               <p>Initially, in terms of authorial intention and audience, and therefore of perceived ideal text, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his editors worked at cross purposes.
                            In the study of modern manuscripts, Donald Reiman has argued for the importance of distinguishing between a manuscript&#x02BC;s status as 
                            <i>public</i>, <i>private</i>, and <i>confidential</i>&#x2014;a distinction that depends, &#x201C;not &#x005B;on&#x005D; its degree of 
                            &#x005B;rhetorical or aesthetic&#x005D; artfulness or the level of personal intimacy between the writer and its readers but the nature and extent of the writer&#x02BC;s intended audience. 
                            A manuscript is <i>private</i> if its author intended it to be read only by one person or a specific small group of people whose identity he knew in advance; 
                            <i>confidential</i> if it was intended for a predefined but larger audience who may&#x2014;or may not&#x2014;be personally known to or interested in the author; 
                            and <i>public</i> only if it was written to be published or circulated for perusal by a widespread, unspecified audience, including such abstractions 
                            as the nation, the reading public, and posterity&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Reiman, <i>The Study of Modern Manuscripts</i></a>, 65). 
                            In the case of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s audience was private, in that he expected his productions to be read primarily by his family, but also confidential, 
                            in that his parents shared his work with friends whose identity he could not predict. For example, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could not have predicted that samples of his verse 
                            composed (probably) for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; would be read by the eminent writer, <span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span>, but <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> took care in his letter prefacing the sample for <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> 
                            to establish confidentiality: &#x201C;Touching my son, there are many to whom I would never name him or his pursuits; but to men of talent and of heart I find I can say 
                            many things that I dare not tell the world at large. It cannot comprehend; it has not patience, nor feeling, nor delicacy&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <i>Memorials of James Hogg</i></a>, 274). 
                            In writing the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> establishes the potential confidentiality of such an audience, not by any prefatory claims on the &#x201C;heart&#x201D; of the reader, 
                            but by <i>imitating</i> public status in a document whose immediate audience is private, his family; that is, 
                            in the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair&#x2010;copy version</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> imitates the materiality of illustrated travel publications of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>, the steel&#x2010;engraved 
                            <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a>, 
                            thereby rendering this version perhaps more confidential than the 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1, version</a>, 
                            which was a private collaboration with his father.

               <p>In editing poems from the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a>, 
                            <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> replaced <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s imitation with the actual conditions and rhetoric of a public production, while creating an illusion of the original work 
                            as less confidential than private in Reiman&#x02BC;s terms. A &#x201C;journal&#x201D; belonging to &#x201C;J.R.&#x201D; seems mysteriously private 
                            in keeping with the nineteenth&#x2010;century cult of the personal, which, as Reiman remarks, led to a fashion for collecting autograph manuscripts 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Reiman, <i>The Study of Modern Manuscripts</i></a>, 18&#x2013;28). 
                            Thus the editor or editors&#x2014;the extent of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s involvement in entitling or revising these poems is unknown&#x2014;widen the supposed gap between public and private. 
                            On the one hand, in <span class="date-1834">1834</span> the general readers of 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath . . . for MDCCCXXXV</i></a>, 
                            might have connected the title, <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a>, 
                            with <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i>; however, on the other hand, the text discourages a sense of the author as an &#x201C;I,&#x201D; 
                            having eliminated the prose pieces that affect an easy, confidentially personal tone, while revising the MS IX versions of 
                            <a href="../showcase/andernacht_poem_msix.php">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</a> and

                            in their published versions. What <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had produced as a confidential, imitatively &#x201C;public&#x201D; manuscript in the 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> recedes&#x2014;or seems to recede&#x2014;into the privileged knowledge of the editor.
               </p>
               
               <p>This sense of the editor as holding insider&#x02BC;s knowledge was enhanced by the publication of 
                            <a href="../showcase/ehrenbreitstein_poem_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</a>

                            in the privately printed and distributed <a href="../notes/poems_1850_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1850)</a>. 
                            For many recipients of that volume, the title must have suggested merely that the editors were adding another &#x201C;fragment&#x201D; 
                            to the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a> 
                            that had so far been made public&#x2014;if, indeed, the title meant even that much, 
                            given that the volume did not reprint the two poems that had formed the original &#x201C;Fragments,&#x201D; 
                            published sixteen years earlier. For readers to perceive this publication as more than just a compounding of fragments&#x2014;rather, 
                            as a sophisticated reinstatement of a missing middle poem that, 
                            in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>, 
                            had bridged the two poems, which were later separated and published as a more severely contrasting pair in 
                            <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>&#x2014;would 
                            have required a perceptive critical reading of the three fragments considered as a unit, 
                            a reading that would in turn have relied on a comprehensive knowledge of the textual history of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            Besides <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself, perhaps only <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName-WHH">W. H. Harrison</span> possessed that privileged and knowledgable perspective. 
                            Since this edition was printed for private circulation, the editors were in a position to share their privileged knowledge with readers. 
                            Still, for many of the original recipients of the volume (as well as for the collectors who acquired copies later), 
                            <a href="../showcase/ehrenbreitstein_poem_1850.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein: Fragment from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</a> 
                            would not have been perceived less as opening up an ideal text of the hitherto unknown portions of a &#x201C;metrical journal,&#x201D; 
                            than as testifying to a private and privileged story about the former omission of this &#x201C;fragment.&#x201D; As <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> wrote to <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span>, 
                            clarifying his intention regarding the audience of the <span class="date-1850">1850</span> collection, &#x201C;the Book although apparently so is not intended to be anonymous 
                            in a Single Instance &#x005B;i.e., of selections included in the anthology&#x005D;. It is only <u>denied</u> the public&#x201D; 
                            (Durham, <span class="date-1850-03-24">24 March 1850</span> &#x005B;MSL 003/004/096&#x005D;, in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MSL003-004" target="_blank" class="inactive">Letters from John James Ruskin to W. H. Harrison, 1838&#x2013;1853</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> situated himself in this tradition of the privileged editor, by virtue of his decision to restrict his <span class="date-1891">1891</span> edition to poetry, 
                            reserving an edition of early prose for a separate volume (see <a href="../notes/poems_1850_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Poems</i> &#x005B;1850&#x005D;</a>). 
                            Now, the audience for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; was again public, but inflected by the culture of rare book collecting, which created a new audience of eager and competitive consumers 
                            for rare copies of the <span class="date-1850">1850</span> <i>Poems</i> by &#x201C;J.R.&#x201C; Thus, in one sense, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s version maintains the tradition 
                            of allowing public access to only fragments from a private horde&#x2014;so private that not even <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself, much less the collector privileged by mere cash 
                            to own the <span class="date-1850">1850</span> <i>Poems</i>, was &#x201C;aware of the amount of material &#x005B;for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x005D; existing in rough copies at the back of . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s&#x005D; book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D; 
                            (see <a href="#PUBLICATION1891">Publication: 1891</a>). In another sense, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> could re&#x2010;frame the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a public work, 
                            available to an anonymous audience, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had told its story in <i>Praeterita</i>. <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> signals this orientation by quoting long, contextualizing passages 
                            from the autobiography at the head of the poem and in his notes; and his his version of the text, which expands the verse selections to cover the full scope of the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> tour, 
                            serves as a poetic, documentary gloss on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s prose autobiographical narration of the master&#x02BC;s first significant experience of Continental landscape and towns. 
                            Yet, if <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> relies on the autobiography to authorize his version of a public text, 
                            his all&#x2010;verse version can claim only faulty authority relative to the manuscript &#x201C;material . . . at the back of . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s&#x005D; book&#x2010;shelves,&#x201D; 
                            for this version is not the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composite&#x2010;genre &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; Ironically, 
                            the manuscript that would have supplied some authorization for such a version&#x2014;the all&#x2010;verse, and perhaps more private collaboration between <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and his father, 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA, <i>g</i>.1</a>&#x2014;was unknown to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s version therefore was a step toward an ideal text of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original intentions for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; only in a limited sense. 
                            As if jealous even of the public dimension that he afforded the work by constructing it as a tour poem illustrative of <i>Praeterita</i>, 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> substituted a new narrative in his <span class="date-1894">1894</span> biography, 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Life and Work of John Ruskin</i></a>, 
                            suggesting that <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s motives in making the work were furtive and separate from his father&#x02BC;s interests, 
                            a closely held harbinger of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mature mission in <i>Modern Painters</i> 
                            (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hanson, &#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</a>). 
                            This conception is almost the opposite of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intention in his youth, which was to imitate a public work of his own time&#x2014;an 
                            imitation of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i>, as acknowledged in <i>Praeterita</i>&#x2014;and which 
                            was meant to be confidentially shared with readers who qualified as &#x201C;men of talent and of heart.&#x201D; 
                            Thus, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s version was a step toward restoration of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original youthful project only in the sense that it provided an expanded framework, 
                            which <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> could dramatically fill out with the poems&#x02BC; missing complementary prose pieces, and with (at least) one reproduction of a hand&#x2010;illustrated page, along with footnotes describing 
                            the remaining drawings and where in the work they are placed. The Library Edition&#x02BC;s version is the first genuine attempt at representing <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s work 
                            as originally conceptualized. At the same time, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> inherited the agendas of their predecessors, and they too inevitably framed the work also 
                            as supplemental material illustrating <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s autobiography.

                            &#x201C;I well remember going with my father into the shop where subscribers entered their names, 
                            and being referred to the specimen print, the turreted window over <span class="placeName-MOSELLE">Moselle</span>, 
                            at <span class="placeName-COBLENTZ">Coblentz</span>. We got the book home to <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> before the time
                            of our usual annual tour&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 39:79; and see 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 286 n. 1). 
                            This work, which was indeed published that spring with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> listed among the printed list of subscribers, 
                            is credited by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, doubtless apocryphally, with having prompted the family&#x02BC;s tour spontaneously, 
                            whereas the journey must in fact have long been in planning: 
                            &#x201C;as my mother watched my father&#x02BC;s pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in reality? 
                            My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes said&#x2014;why not? And there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 39:79). It was likely the case, however, 
                            that <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> helped to orient the family to the north of Europe, as <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> oriented them to the southern region of the Continent 
                            (see ).
               </p>
               
               <p>While these two publications of course did not hold exclusive sway over either the Ruskins&#x02BC; tour itinerary or <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s embodiment of their experiences in the <span class="title-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s and <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s books did play an important and representative role in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s conceptualization of his family&#x02BC;s northern and southern destinations, 
                            and in the interplay of tourism and the materiality of travel writing and publication in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles</i></span> provided a pictorial tour through 
                            <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span> and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, 
                            whereas <span class="persName-SP">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> led the reader on the more traditional Grand Tour of the South. 
                            The books contrasted also in their material representations. The <i>Facsimiles</i> consists of fifty lithographic prints 
                            of picturesque medieval and Renaissance architectural sites in northern <span class="geogName-EUROPE">Europe</span>, and it contains no letterpress&#x2014;only 
                            the place names lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of the image, to identify the locales depicted. 
                            The lithographs, then a new medium in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, would have struck the Ruskins with their dramatically large size 
                            (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor&#x2010;like texture, as compared with the exquisite preciousness of the finely etched, steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes 
                            (2&#x2013;3 inches by 3&#x2013;4 inches) that illustrate <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1830">1830</span>
                  <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. (A more typical size for the engraved area of steel&#x2010;engraved book illustration was 7 by 5 inches 
                            &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hunnisett, <i>Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</i></a>, 35&#x005D;.) 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> was also a more traditional work, despite its up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date reliance on the 
                            new technologies of steel engraving and mass production that sponsored the boom in <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a>. 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s verse and taste were late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century in manner, and his <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> could not compete in popularity with 
                            <span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span>&#x02BC;s fourth part of <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i></span>, which is set in <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem gained popular acclaim solely by means of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition&#x02BC;s graphic enhancements 
                            (see <a href="../notes/samuel_rogers_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> underwent a development parallel to that of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s work, from a travelogue written solely in verse and in an eighteenth&#x2010;century manner 
                            of topographical poetry, to an illustrated composite&#x2010;genre travel narrative typical of the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">annuals</a> 
                            of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span> (see <a href="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</a>). As remarked above, there is some ambiguity concerning when the Ruskin family 
                            acquired a copy of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, which they already owned in an earlier, non&#x2010;illustrated version. 
                            Regardless of when the book entered the household, however, its influence is palpable from the start of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a>. Critics have focused too exclusively on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                            as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s model, at the cost tracing his imitation of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-book-PROUTSKETCHES"><i>Facsimiles</i></span> 
                            (see, e.g., <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SPEARRUSKINSITALY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Spear, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Italy&#x201D;</a>), 
                            but it is true that <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s book frames the foundational layout and conception of the composite&#x2010;genre <span class="title-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span>. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> modeled his section divisions on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s layout, observing how text and illustration form a coherent unit. 
                            Like <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, he entitles his topographical sections so as to identify a landmark destination&#x2014;&#x201C;Calais,&#x201D; &#x201C;Cassel,&#x201D; &#x201C;Lille,&#x201D; &#x201C;Brussels,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;The Meuse,&#x201D; &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle,&#x201D; &#x201C;Cologne,&#x201D; &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; &#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D; and 
                            &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;&#x2014;and for these section titles, he uses a lettering that imitates <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s restrained display type. 
                            (&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D; and &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D; are missing their headings, owing to the unfinished state of the fair copy.) 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s placement of illustration vis&#x2010;à&#x2010;vis text likewise imitates <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s layout, 
                            by heading the first page of each section with a landscape vignette, above the title, 
                            in order to situate the reader in a distinct place, and by closing each section with a figure vignette, as a tailpiece in order to caption some portion of the narrative.
               </p>
               
               <p>In this arrangement of text and image, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> captured a notable innovation of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. 
                            <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> probably based his layout on the admired designs by 
                            <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</span> (<span class="date-1757-1830">1757&#x2013;1830</span>) for his <span class="orgName-">Shakspeare Press</span>, 
                            particularly <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</span>&#x02BC;s editions in the <span class="date-1790-1799">1790s</span> of English poets, with wood&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <span class="persName-">Thomas Bewick</span> (<span class="date-1753-1828">1753&#x2013;1828</span>) 
                            set at the heads of title pages of the poems 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Piggott, <i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></a>, 20). 
                            This elegant page layout was not possible in the mass&#x2010;produced 
                            <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a>, which first arose in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. 
                            In order to achieve wide distribution, these popular books relied on the durability of steel engraving, 
                            an intaglio process that clashes with relief type. In the eighteenth&#x2010;century illustrated book, <span class="persName-">Bewick</span>&#x02BC;s fine wood engravings could be set in the same frame as the type, 
                            allowing text and image to be printed together on the same page. To solve this problem, and achieve the elegant effects of <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</span>&#x02BC;s designs, 
                            and yet print the books on a massive scale, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s printers innovated a technique, 
                            which was widely remarked in reviews of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                            whereby precise registration allowed the sheets to be run through the press twice, once for the engraving, and once for the type 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes and the Making of Rogers&#x02BC; &#x2018;Italy&#x2019;&#x201D;</a>, 3). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was attentive to this up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date innovation.
               </p>
               
               <p>But <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copy version is not just an illustrated travel poem, but a composite&#x2010;genre travelogue, combining prose with verse and illustration. 
                            Although <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i> is subtitled <i>A Poem</i>, the author 
                            did include some prose&#x2014;brief essays and a tale&#x2014;in &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; (<span class="date-1828">1828</span>) of the work 
                            (&#x201C;National Prejudices,&#x201D; &#x201C;Caius Cestius,&#x201D; &#x201C;Foreign Travel,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Bag of Gold,&#x201D; in 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> (1828)</a>, 
                            35&#x2013;40, 51&#x2013;52, 62&#x2013;71, 107&#x2013;19); and he reprinted these prose pieces and added two more tales to the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition 
                            (&#x201C;Marcolini&#x201D; and &#x201C;Marco Griffoni,&#x201D; in 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1830" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italy</i> (1830)</a>, 
                            85&#x2013;87, 230&#x2013;32). But <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> disperses his few prose pieces irregularly, with at most a pattern of loose association 
                            with their immediately surrounding poems, whereas <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> constructs each of his topographical sections (with one exception), using both verse and prose. 
                            Unlike <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> does not independently title his prose pieces, but subordinates them to the topographical unit, 
                            separating prose from poem with a drawing, which serves as a hinge between the writing and binds the parts into an associative, but still coherent unit. 
                            While complementing the poems, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s prose pieces also contrast with his rather generalized, picturesque poetic views, by bringing them down to earth 
                            with first&#x2010;person, anecdotal and comedic commentary about specific locale.
               </p>
               
               <p>By this arrangement, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> amplifies the pattern of text and illustration in the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <i>Italy</i>, which typically consists of a landscape vignette 
                            after a drawing by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> as a header, above a poem&#x02BC;s title, and a figure vignette after a drawing by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> as a tailpiece. While in its present condition, 
                            the <a href="../showcase/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IX fair copy</a> is missing many drawings 
                            (see <a href="#FAIRCOPY">Fair Copy</a>), sufficient examples remain in place to confirm <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s intentions. 
                            Compared to <i>Italy</i>, the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; not only complements each poem with a prose piece, 
                            but also supplies each poem and prose piece with its own headpiece and tailpiece&#x2014;four vignettes in total 
                            for each topographical unit, the prose piece&#x02BC;s vignette serving as the hinge. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> honors <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s pattern of using a landscape or cityscape as a headpiece, 
                            and a figure drawing as tailpiece, but he varies the pattern somewhat (as does <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>) by occasionally heading a section or a prose piece 
                            with a more anecdotal, narrative vignette.
               </p>
               
               <p>The most striking variation is the section on &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle,&#x201D; which begins with an imposing drawing 
                            in <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s manner of the city&#x02BC;s cathedral, followed by the section heading, but which proceeds with a prose piece only, and no poem. 
                            At the end of the section, the manuscript shows a large gap, which may have been meant to be filled by a tailpiece, but which was more likely reserved 
                            for the headpiece of the following section, &#x201C;Cologne&#x201D; (for which the heading is lettered at the bottom of the page). 
                            The condensation of this section&#x02BC;s parts into only a drawing and a prose piece contrasts with the expansion and elaboration that prevails in other sections. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carries the condensation into the prose commentary, which he writes in both the comic and the picturesque modes (the latter typically represented by verse 
                            in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;), with the speaker first riffing on the <span class="date-1748-04-24">Peace of Aix la Chapelle</span> to mock the somnolent &#x201C;peace treaties&#x201D; governing the local postillions, 
                            but then rhapsodically describing with the sublimity of the cathedral&#x02BC;s interior in moonlight. Finally, the speaker parodies a guidebook&#x02BC;s art and artifact tour 
                            of the cathedral. Perhaps <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> chose &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; as an exercise in condensation in order to signify the city&#x02BC;s pivotal geographical position 
                            at the juncture of <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>, <span class="placeName-NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</span>, and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, and the its distinctive, imperial status.
               </p>
               
               <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> carries out the principle of elaborating <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s pattern to its fullest in the sections on &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; and &#x201C;St. Goar.&#x201D; The outer sections of the trio work as contrasts&#x2014;the first, gothic in mode; and the third, domestic. Between them, 
                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D; plays with the topic of confluence, as the meeting point of the darkly gothic and of sunny domesticity, symbolized by the meeting point 
                            of the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine River</span> and the <span class="geogName-MOSELLE">Moselle River</span>. The fortress of <span class="placeName-EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</span> looms over the rivers&#x02BC; juncture, depicted by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in a vignette copied after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>. 
                            Each of the sections is planned for the fullest complement of poetry, prose, and drawings; together, the three sections traverse an elaborate yet balanced 
                            range of topographical modes.
               </p>
               
               <p>In his drawings imitating engravings, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> strives to harmonize his illustrations with text in the manner of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s landscape illustrator, 
                            <a href="../notes/turner_j_m_w_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">J. M. W. Turner (1775&#x2013;1851)</a>, 
                            who exploited the potential of fine&#x2010;lined but durable steel engraving to allow indefinite borders of an engraving to melt into the white space of the paper, 
                            creating a world within the page 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Piggott, <i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></a>, 14&#x2013;16). 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s drawings emphasize how such frameless, soft&#x2010;edged rectangular, square, or oval designs harmonize 
                            with his left&#x2010; and right&#x2010;justified blocks of text to make a unity of effect. Less noticed is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s attention to the contrasting textures of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s lithographs, 
                            such as his copy of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Liege,&#x201D; which concludes the section on &#x201C;The Meuse.&#x201D; Exacting as it is, the copy is not just mechanical, but an exploration of 
                            the anecdotal, touristic world of the traveler&#x02BC;s picturesque opened up by the fluid and watercolor&#x2010;like texture of a lithograph, 
                            as compared with the fairy world of light and exotic landscape revealed by the exquisite intaglio of <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s vignettes. As the largest of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s drawings 
                            for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; set broadside and filling an entire page of the MS IX notebook, the &#x201C;Liege&#x201D; copy comments also on the scale 
                            of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s folio&#x2010;sized <i>Facsimiles</i> as a contrast with the miniature vignette illustrations for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i>.
               </p>
               
               <p>In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s liveliness of response to the material world of art production and reproduction that guided early Victorian picturesque travel, his achievement 
                            in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; poses possibilities that are neglected by interpretations that insist on the narrow constraints and neuroticism of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s early self&#x2010;instruction 
                            in drawing. For example, Paul H. Walton  sees <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s adoption of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;outline style&#x201D; of depicting old architecture with &#x201C;broken lines and dots&#x201D; 
                            as one example of the youth&#x02BC;s tendency &#x201C;to revert to pen and ink in more factual studies of picturesque buildings and views,&#x201D; 
                            owing to a misguided direction of &#x201C;his earliest art activity . . . along lines strictly defined by adult standards and ideas of what 
                            was educationally desirable, so that he was not encouraged, nor did he have the time, to draw in a playful way the kinds of figure subjects in which a child 
                            imaginatively expresses and defines a conception of himself within a framework of human relationships.&#x201D; As a contrast with this &#x201C;crippl&#x005B;ing&#x005D;&#x201D; of his 
                            imagination, which &#x201C;had much to do with the tragedy of his personal life,&#x201D; Walton points to &#x201C;the happy, normal family life of a boy&#x201D; like <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            later sexual nemesis, John Everett Millais, whose youthful drawings included the kind of &#x201C;subjects usually preferred by boy artists: 
                            soldiers, animals, machines, caricatures of family and friends.&#x201D; As a consequence, even when a prospect of freedom opened up in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s youthful art teaching, 
                            such as when his first drawing master, <a href="../notes/runciman_charles_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Charles Runciman (1798&#x2013;1864)</a> challenged the boy &#x201C;to imitate the free, 
                            controlled sweep of the pencil in . . . &#x005B;the teacher&#x02BC;s&#x005D; models,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> retreated to his more formal depictions of buildings in pen and ink 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WALTONDRAWINGS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Walton, <i>Drawings of John Ruskin</i></a>, 13, 7, 8, 7, 6). 
                            It is not true, however, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing and drawings neglect subjects appropriate to &#x201C;boy artists&#x201D;; 
                            more importantly, Walton&#x02BC;s division of the normative from the creative, laden with convention, omits how spontaneity and invention can be prompted 
                            in surprising ways, and one of these is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s playfulness in manipulating the material culture surrounding a youth of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. Just as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> not only amuses himself 
                            with shrinking the dimensions of the &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; section, but also insightfully considers how he can work within these self&#x2010;imposed contraints 
                            to make his prose for this section compensate for the lack of a poem by multiplying its registers of effect, 
                            so he both playfully and meaningfully shrinks the scale of his Proutesque drawing 
                            for the &#x201C;Lille&#x201D; section, with its topic of recession and expansion through motion&#x2014;the travelers receding &#x201C;Farther and farther . . . / From <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span>s insulated crest&#x201D; to where &#x201C;Lille upon us sudden 
                            broke&#x201D; in its &#x201C;rich irregularity&#x201D; of &#x201C;form and figure fair, / . . . moving, breathing, living there&#x201D; (<a href="../showcase/lille_poem_msix.php">"Lille"</a>, 
                            lines 11&#x2013;12, 32, 38&#x2013;40). In a contrasting strategy, he swells his Proutesque drawing of the facade of Aachen Cathedral for &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; to almost 
                            a full page, in keeping with the prose description of a monumental cathedral as &#x201C;a noble, a beautiful, a sublime thing&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../showcase/aix_la_chapelle_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</a>).
               </p>
               
               <p>Viewed in this way, the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; seems less the &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D; that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                            condemned in <i>Praeterita</i> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:81), 
                            than a project that had yielded as much creative potential as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> could teach himself, 
                            despite his compulsively listing future additions to the work on the back flyleaves of <a href="../apparatuses/msviii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS VIII</a>. 
                            The project propelled him forward into active participation as the author, &#x201C;J.R.,&#x201D; in the material culture of ekphrastic and topographical 
                            illustrated publication.

                  <p>For British travelers in the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>, emergent developments in touristic experience were perhaps most vivid in new and less familiar routes 
                            opening up in northern Europe alongside the well&#x2010;worn path of the Grand Tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. 
                            Apart from the attraction of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span> Field, travel in the Pas&#x2010;de&#x2010;Calais and <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span> remained 
                            comparatively unfamiliar except as a route to be got over as quickly as possible on the way to <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>. 
                            While in <i>Praeterita</i> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exaggerates the solitary significance of 
                            <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Facsimiles</i> (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>) in prompting the family&#x02BC;s 
                            journey, the artist&#x02BC;s early importance to British perceptions of northern Europe is corroborated by the novelty of his representations of towns

                            based on an <span class="date-1821">1821</span> tour (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LOCKETTPROUT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Lockett, <i>Samuel Prout</i></a>, 50&#x2013;53).

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Since <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> had established his lead in depicting the market towns of the Low Countries and <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> 
                            since the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, his <i>Facsimiles</i> of <span class="date-1833">1833</span> 
                            may well have served as a kind of guidebook for the Ruskins (although of course they could not take a folio volume with them). <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s views would have 
                            persuaded them to adopt a more leisurely and attentive pace through these towns, on the first leg of their Continental tour. 
                            In fact, the route that the Ruskins traced through northern <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> and along the <span class="placeName-RHINE">Rhine</span> 
                            in <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span> is strikingly similar to the actual path of <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s sketching tour 
                            of <span class="date-1821">1821</span>, although the sequence of the published lithographs in <i>Facsimiles</i> departs somewhat from the actual route,

                  <p>In forming the persona <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was influenced not only by literary and artistic sources, 
                                but also by living poets and artists 
                                whom he was fortunate to meet or correspond with during his conceptualization and composition of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; These contacts became especially important 
                                as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was &#x201C;brought forward&#x201D; as a professional contributor to 
                                <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>

                                Two of these men present a striking contrast with one another&#x2014;<a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</a> and 
                                <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank">James Hogg (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</a>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> also had some contact at this time with 
                                <a href="../notes/loudon_j_c_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">John Claudius Loudon (1783&#x2013;1843)</a>.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The personae of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> and <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> each exhibited multiple and even contradictory sides, and the Ruskins must have been selective 
                                about what aspects of these public figures they hoped to cultivate in the patronage of their precocious son. 
                                Respecting <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, the Ruskins thought of him in his role as the <span class="persName-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span>, who was romantically imagined as having received his call to poetry 
                                when he was shepherd in Ettrick Forest in the <span class="placeName-">Scottish Borders</span>, 
                                and who still resided in georgic retirement on his farm in the <span class="geogName-YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</span>. 
                                The Ruskins would have played down <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s colorful and risqu&#x00E9; character in the &#x201C;Noctes Ambrosianae&#x201D; 
                                in <i>Blackwood&#x02BC;s Edinburgh Magazine</i>. This side of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> appealed to the Brontë siblings, 
                                who imitated the bravado and swagger of these dialogues in their own collaborative and competitive writing, 
                                but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s parents would hardly have considered such a persona as an appropriate model 
                                for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s solitary and decorous authorship.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>When the Ruskins first met <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> personally in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, he was undertaking his first visit to the metropolis of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                                where was lionized by <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> society. <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s introduction to the Ruskins came by way of the community of expatriate Scottish literati in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> 
                                who surrounded the publishing firms of <span class="orgName-MURRAY">John Murray</span> and <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>. The latter, in particular, as the publisher of 
                                <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 
                                served as the hub for these connections: <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> as a contributor to the annual; 
                                <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</a>, 
                                as editor, and longtime friend of <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>; and even <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin, 
                                <a href="../notes/richardson_charles_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Charles Thomas Richardson (1811&#x2013;34)</a>, as a shopboy with the firm, 
                                who was the first to present <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> with a copy of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> (probably the <span class="date-1829">1829</span> 
                                or <span class="date-1830">1830</span> volume, both of which contained contributions by <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, in sharp contrast with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, was the urbane &#x201C;man of taste,&#x201D; whose townhouse in <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Square</span> 
                                was a showplace of exquisitely curated Regency neoclassicism, and the scene of his famous breakfasts in which <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> acted the part of social arbiter 
                                of the current <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> artistic and literary scene. In his most positive light, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> might have appeared to the Ruskins as a splendid embodiment 
                                of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s tastes and aspirations. A former associate of <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, and a habitu&#x00E9; of at least the byways of fame, 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> had earned a sound reputation for his topographical poem, <i>Italy</i>, 
                                which may have paled in comparison to the popular glare of <i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i>, 
                                but which was respectably and approachably neoclassical&#x2014;regular in its versification, and grounded in the tradition of the 
                                Grand Tour to <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was also, like <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, a successful businessman, having made his fortune in banking; 
                                and even though he lavished extravagant sums on artists, engravers, and printers in order to satisfy his perfectionism in crafting editions of his poetry, 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> recouped his huge investment in his illustrated edition of <i>Italy</i> and profited handsomely by its unprecedented sales. 
                                The unattractive side of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was his notoriously acid wit and his worldliness at a time when middle&#x2010;class Evangelical earnestness 
                                was turning the tide on the influence of Regency &#x201C;men of taste.&#x201D;
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The two writers also differed profoundly in taste. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was so committed to his neoclassicism that <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> 
                                reined in his apocalyptic manner typical of his other works of the period in favor of a style that would harmonize with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s restraint, 
                                by using less dramatic perspective in his vignette designs for <i>Italy</i>

                                The artist whom <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> most admired and hoped to secure as illustrator for his grandest gift book, a deluxe edition of <i>The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</i>, 
                                was <span class="persName-JMARTIST">John Martin</span> (<span class="date-1789">1789</span>&#x2010;<span class="date-1854">1854</span>)&#x2014;the artist who, 
                                ever far from restraining the apocalyptic, made his career by exploiting such subjects for their most histrionic theatricality and scale 
                                (All too typically for the hapless author, and despite generous subscription donations 
                                by <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> and others, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s deluxe edition was never produced owing to disruptions in trade caused by Reform agitation in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>;

                  <p>Of the two relationships, the Ruskins&#x02BC; contact with <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> is the best documented 
                                (see <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank">James Hogg (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</a>). 
                                Their apparent preference for the <span class="persName-JH">Ettrick Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s advice about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s future as a poet, when the youth was laboring over the

                                Compared to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> may have seemed hapless in his fortunes: his <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> venture ended in him foolishly mislaying his trust in an under&#x2010;financed publisher, 
                                who went bankrupt and squandered the opportunity to produce a collected edition worthy of the author, whereas <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> boasted the means to encase his writing 
                                in increasing splendor. (In <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, when <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> wrote to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> about <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;promise of very considerable talent,&#x201D; 
                                <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> followed up the success of his <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <i>Italy</i> with an edition of his collected <i>Poems</i>,

                                for true elegance and pictorial fancy, is unequalled, in an age remarkable for its love of splendid books&#x201D;

                                Nonetheless, when writing to <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> sounds pointed in addressing <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> as a man &#x201C;of talent and of heart,&#x201D;

                  <p>Despite <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s sentiments, both <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s successes and <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s disappointments were endemic to a period of transition between publishing in the age of

                                in the age of <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span>. In a time when critical discourse commonly bemoaned the decline of poetry in unpropitious circumstances 
                                (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BRISTOWVICTORIANPOETINTRO" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bristow, &#x201C;Introduction,&#x201D; <i>Victorian Poet</i></a>, 4&#x2013;5), 
                                both <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> and <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> appreciated how poetry could gain new life from its relation with the visual arts&#x2014;a 
                                relation that was rooted in tradition reaching back to the humanist dialogue or <i>paragone</i> between the sister arts, 
                                yet that was also undergoing renewal and transformation by mass&#x2010;market print technologies. Both men shrewdly exploited the changes in print technology 
                                that created new venues and audiences for literature and art, such as the <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">annuals and other illustrated books</a> 
                                (on <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>&#x02BC;s enterprising approach to these venues during an otherwise depressed period in literary publishing, see

                  <p>The sole anecdote to survive concerning <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s audience with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> can be read in terms of commonalities shared by these mentors 
                                in the literary and artistic culture of the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. We have no contemporary documentation of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s introduction to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> under <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s wing, 
                                other than evidence of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s regular entr&#x00E9;e to <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span>

                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s later story about his supposed contretemps of &#x201C;congratulating . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x005D; with enthusiasm 
                                on the beauty of the engravings by which his poems were illustrated,&#x201D; indicating that the youth knew &#x201C;more of the vignettes 
                                &#x005B;in <i>Italy</i>&#x005D; than the verses,&#x201D; and the chiding of <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> &#x201C;that, in future, 
                                when . . . in the company of distinguished men, . . . &#x005B;he&#x005D; should listen more attentively to their conversation&#x201D; 
                                evokes a bygone era that valued polite conversation and dilettantish colleccting

                                Yet, while <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> fits the anecdote into what he now regarded as his fatuous beginnings as a poet, his misplaced complements to the illustrator 
                                proves him to have been a boy of his decade, who had so carefully studied the visual culture represented by <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Italy</i> 
                                as well as by <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Facsimiles</i>. (While we do not know when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s introduction to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> occurred, 
                                it is a reasonable guess that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> secured an audience on the strength of the youth&#x02BC;s precocious achievement in the

                  <p>In the mentoring of <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>, perhaps the most important qualification is indicated by a word dropped in the only 
                                mention of a publication by <span class="persName-JR">John</span> to survive in the family correspondence of <span class="date-1834">1834</span>. In a verse letter to his father dated <span class="date-1834-03-10">10 March 1834</span>, 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions&#x2014;not <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>&#x2014;but 
                                <a href="../notes/loudon_j_c_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">John Claudius Loudon (1783&#x2013;1843)</a>, the editor 
                                of botanical, landscaping, and other natural history publications. A key is that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> regarded <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span> as a &#x201C;friend&#x201D; of the family: 
                                &#x201C;To <span class="persName-JCL">Mr. Loudon</span>, as a friend, / By way of some communication, / Some kind of little lucubration / On any sort of observation, 
                                / Among the <span class="geogName-ALPS">Alps</span>, you know, / On Micaslate, or any slates, / Granite, and gold, or toads and snakes, / I think that I shall make a show&#x201D; 
                                (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 285). 
                                <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was alluding to his geological notes&#x2014;dated <span class="date-1834-03">March 1834</span>, but published later that year&#x2014;in <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>&#x02BC;s 
                                <i>Magazine of Natural History</i>,

                                <a href="../apparatuses/facts_and_considerations_on_the_strata_of_mont_blanc_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">"Facts and Considerations on the Strata of Mont Blanc, and on Some Instances of Twisted Strata Observable in Switzerland"</a>. 
                                One is struck by the apparent anomaly that the one forthcoming publication to merit <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s attention&#x2014;if he was as yet apprised of his other firsts for this year, 
                                the poetry commissions for <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>&#x2014;were these geological observations, and later in life <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would find it convenient 
                                to stress his keenness of factual observation at the expense of his poetic effusion. Again, however, one can perceive commonalities. 
                                <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>, like <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> and <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span>, was a Scot&#x2014;a member of the extended &#x201C;family&#x201D; 
                                of Scottish literati in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> who surrounded the boy wonder, many of whom visited 
                                <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. <span class="persName-JCL">Loudon</span>&#x02BC;s publications also depended on the thriving visual culture 
                                of illustrated books and magazines during the period, and they were perhaps not too distant from the poetry anthologies in their communal appraoch, 
                                inviting amateurs to contribute to forums such as the 
                                <a href="../notes/magazine_of_natural_history_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Magazine of Natural History</i></a> 
                                and trade &#x201C;lucubrations&#x201D; that did not necessarily depend on professional status.
