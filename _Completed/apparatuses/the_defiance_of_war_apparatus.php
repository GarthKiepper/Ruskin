            <p>This poem, with its exhortation to guard &#x201C;our peaceful home&#x201D; from suffering and death, could allude to the removal of

            <p>The oddly belligerent pacifist message of this poem, combined with its placement alongside poems celebrating both <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> and British pride of manufacture, appears to support <span class="persName-LC">Linda Colley</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        argument that British identity, <span class="placeName-NBRITAIN">North</span> and <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">South</span>, was forged &#x201C;not so much &#x005B;by&#x005D; consensus or homogeneity or centralisation at home, as &#x005B;by&#x005D; a strong sense of dissimilarity from those without.&#x201D; 
                        Fear of the <span class="orgName-ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic other</span> dominated over divisions between <span class="orgName-CHURCHOFENGLAND">Anglicanism</span> and Dissent, and Old and New Dissent, so that Britons defended above all a &#x201C;pluralist yet aggressively Protestant polity&#x201D;; 
                        and recurrent wars with <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, along with worries about Jacobite restoration, had kept alive the fear &#x201C;that the old popish enemy was still at the gates, more threatening than ever before&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BRITONS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Colley, <i>Britons</i></a>, 17, 19, 25, and see p. 18). The 
                        primary function of the fears expressed in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.
                    
            </p> 
            
            <p><span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> presumably picked up on these alarms in his parents, each 
                        of whom is likely to have communicated them, perhaps <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> even more so than <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>. As <span class="persName-LC">Colley</span> remarks, during the <span class="date-1789-05-05-1799-11-09">Revolutionary</span>
                        and <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic</span> Era, &#x201C;many women . . . seem to have believed that their own security and the security of the family unit 
                        were at stake in this <span class="date-1789-05-05-1815-06-18">French war</span> as they had not been in earlier conflicts. In part, this was because the risk of a French invasion of <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> was so much greater in this war than ever before. 
                        But crucial, too, as an ingredient in female anxiety was the destruction of <span class="persName-MAJ">Marie&#x2010;Antoinette</span> and the rest of the French Royal Family&#x201D;&#x2014;a regicide that 
                        <span class="persName-EB">Edmund Burke</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-essay-BURKEREFLECTIONS-italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</span> 
                        (<span class="date-1790">1790</span>) taught the elder Ruskins&#x02BC; generation to stigmatize specifically in terms &#x201C;of a queen who was also a wife and mother being driven by force from her home&#x201D;
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BRITONS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Colley, <i>Britons</i></a>, 254, 253). Hence, 
                        the martial twist given to domestic feeling in this poem is not at all out of keeping with a feminine and domestic emphasis&#x2014;an emphasis that is strong throughout 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, in domestic scenes depicted in <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</span></a>, 
                        the most realistic of which center on the children&#x02BC;s interaction with the Mama character, and in the stamp 
                        that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> herself puts on the manuscript with her <a href="../apparatuses/mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">glosses</a>.
                    
            </p>
            
            <p>It is far more probable that the poem functions in this way, as a reflector of Britons&#x02BC; self&#x2010;defining fears of the Other, than that it 
                        records an actual threat at the time of its composition. The latest credible threat of invasion of British shores had ended 
                        in <span class="date-1815">1815</span> with the <span class="date-1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</span>, which closed the <span class="date-1799-11-09-1815-06-18">Napoleonic Wars</span>. 
                        <span class="date-1815-06-18">Waterloo</span> captured <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s imagination throughout the <span class="date-1826-1829">late 1820s</span>, in works such as <a href="../apparatuses/the_british_battles_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-THEBRITISHBATTLES">&#x201C;The British Battles&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/battle_of_waterloo_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-drama-BATTLEOFWATERLOOPLAY">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts&#x201D;</span></a>,

                        Just so, <span class="persName-CBW">Charlotte</span> and <span class="persName-PBB">Branwell</span> Brontë made <span class="persName-AWW">Wellington</span> the hero of their sagas, 
                        but <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fascination with the <span class="date-1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</span> was not drawn just from books. 
                        A year earlier than compiling the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; &#x005B;MS I Poetry Anthology&#x005D;</span></a>, 
                        during the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1825_note.php" target="_blank">Tour of 1825</a> to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>, 
                        the Ruskins visited <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo Field</span>.
                    
            </p>
            
            <p>Although composed nine years after <span class="date-1815-06-18">Waterloo</span>, <span class="title-poem-THEDEFIANCEOFWAR">&#x201C;The Defiance of War&#x201D;</span> was more likely prompted by the <span class="date-1825">1825</span> 
                        tour along with the national anxieties analyzed by <span class="persName-LC">Colley</span> 
                        than to have reflected some more recent conflict. Nonetheless, one cannot discount the possibility that a conflict contemporary with composition of the poem caught the 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s imagination. In <span class="date-1826-09-1826-12">late 1826</span>, 
                        a skirmish occurred in the East, in connection with the <span class="date-1821-03-06-1832-05-07">Greek War for Independence</span> from Turkish domination. 
                        While no threat to <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, the war would have interested the Ruskins for its associations with 
                        <a href="../notes/byron_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span></a>, who had died in <span class="placeName-MISSOLONGHI">Missolonghi</span> in
                        <span class="date-1824">1824</span>. In the <span class="date-1821-03-06-1832-05-07">Greek conflict</span>, <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> was striving to avoid an outbreak 
                        between <span class="placeName-TURKEY">Turkey</span> and <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russia</span>, whose new tsar, <span class="persName-TS1">Nicholas I</span>, was willing
                        to push hostilities. In <span class="date-1826-10">October 1826</span>, which would accord well with a probable date for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s
                        poem, <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> pressured <span class="placeName-TURKEY">Turkey</span> to accept Russian conditions in the <span class="date-1826-10-07">Convention of Akkerman</span>. This assured Russian influence in the
                        <span class="geogName-CAUCASUS">Caucasus</span> and the opening of the <span class="geogName-BOSPHORUSSTRT">Straits of Bosphorus</span> to trade, which might have interested the Ruskins&#x02BC; mercantile household.
                        As it turned out, <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russia</span> continued to press hostilities in the name of the Greek cause, and <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> joined <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span> and <span class="placeName-RUSSIA">Russia</span> to declare
                        joint mediation, according to a treaty signed in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> in <span class="date-1827-07">July 1827</span>, but this event would certainly have
                        occurred too late to have occasioned <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem. (In the subsequent history, the Turks refused mediation but were defeated by
                        allied fleets at <span class="placeName-NAVARINO">Navarino</span> in <span class="date-1827-10">October 1827</span>. The <span class="date-1829-09-14">Treaty of Adrianople</span>, rendering <span class="placeName-GREECE">Greece</span> autonomous, was signed
                        two years later, in <span class="date-1829-09">September 1829</span>.)
            </p>
            
            <p>For a threat closer to home, one returns to the Catholic Other, even in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. The <span class="orgName-ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</span> fear was kept alive in the years running up to the <span class="date-1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829</span>, perhaps all the more so in households 
                        like the Ruskins&#x02BC; that had to strain to forge together competing loyalties to form a British identity. In those post&#x2010;<span class="date-1815-06-18">Waterloo</span> years, <span class="persName-LC">Colley</span> points out, 
                        anti&#x2010;Catholic agitation was sustained by &#x201C;an abundance of women&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BRITONS" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Britons</i></a>, 333). 
                        In <span class="date-1829-02">February 1829</span>, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>, observing the advance of <span class="date-1829-03-24">Catholic Emancipation</span>, would be moved to put aside her suburban calm and flash out against &#x201C;the R Catholics and their favourers&#x201D; as &#x201C;weak 
                        equivocal underhand equally devoid of sincerity or honesty &#x0026; integrity&#x201D; and capable of &#x201C;tak&#x005B;ing&#x005D; Satan himself into their cabals to further their purposes 
                        to bring every thing under their subjection&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 177).
            </p>
            
            <p>Another overdetermining possibility is that the poem also works figuratively to comment on the illness and death of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s
                        cousin, <a href="../notes/richardson_james_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James Richardson</span></a> (see
                        <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-ONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</span>: Discussion</a>). If so, the poem shows how <span class="persName-JR">the boy</span>&#x02BC;s
                        grief for his <span class="persName-JRPSON">cousin</span> might have mixed with alarm over the threat that disease posed to the peace of the household. As an intriguing clue, 
                        <span class="persName-CWB">Charles W. Borchers, IV</span> has discovered beneath the title an erased word that appears to be <i>woe</i>.
