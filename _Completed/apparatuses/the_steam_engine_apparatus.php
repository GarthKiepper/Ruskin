            <p>In <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, the poem is identified only as &#x201C;poem I,&#x201D; the first poem in the 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-">MS I Poetry Anthology</span></a>. Other poems in the 
                        anthology carry a substantive title along with the numbered designation &#x201C;poem II,&#x201D; &#x201C;poem III,&#x201D; and so 
                        on.
            </p>
            
            <p>Between the heading &#x201C;poem I&#x201D; and the text of the poem, however, there is visible the letter <i>o</i>, followed by an erased 
                        line that is centered on the page like a title&#x2014;&#x201C;The hunt by dar&#x201D; or the last three letters may be 
                        &#x201C;day.&#x201D; If the last three letters are <i>dar</i>, they probably refer to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s source, a 
                        poem by <a href="../notes/darwin_erasmus_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-ED">Erasmus Darwin</span></a> 
                        (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). The erased title, if that is what it is, perhaps belonged to the 
                        draft: other partial erasures beneath the text reveal apparently that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> copied a draft or semi&#x2010;final version here, in 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, 
                        and then erased the draft as he printed the fair copy over top (see <a href="../notes/hand_note.php" target="_blank">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</a>).
            </p>
            
            <p>The title &#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D; was invented by 
                        <a href="../notes/collingwood_w_g_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> for

                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> perhaps based his title on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s commentary on the poem 
                        in <span class="title-book-"><i>Praeterita</i></span>

                        override the most straightforward interpretation of <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s having assigned 
                        the date of <span class="date-1826-01">January 1826</span> specifically to <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        and thereby singling out that work, possibly, as Ruskin&#x02BC;s first poem.
            </p>
            
            <p>On internal evidence, <span class="title-poem-THESTEAMENGINE">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; &#x005B;𠇜The Steam Engine&#x201D;&#x005D;</span> 
                        is more logically placed in <span class="date-1826-09-1826-12">late 1826</span> or 
                        <span class="date-1827-01-1827-04">early 1827</span>, since during that period, according to another annotation by his <span class="persName-MR">mother</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> completed the entirety of this <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a> (see 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</span>: Date</a>; 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span>: Date</a>). In keeping with this interpretation, 
                        the content of the poem is consistent with the kinds of sources pervading the concluding chapters of 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</span></a>, which
                        precedes the anthology. Both the prose lesson and the poem reflect the preoccupations of Enlightenment educationists, 
                        and it is logical that, compositionally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> maintained the theme of scientific and industrial optimism as he completed the prose lesson 
                        and started the poetry anthology.

                        represented, as well as being steeped in the Romanticism of <a href="../notes/scott_walter_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (1771&#x2013;1832)</a>.

                        At the same time, as Early Victorians, the Ruskins were able to absorb these influences seemingly safely immune to the political radicalism of this earlier generation.
            </p>
            
            <p>Besides the popularity of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s works that would have made him known to the Ruskin family 
                        (and his sometimes notoriety for freethinking), <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would have encountered his poetry in quotations by the educational writers 
                        who formed part of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s large acquaintance and whose books filled <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        boyhood. For example, <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s lines on the steam engine are quoted in Conversation 40, 
                        &#x201C;Of the Steam&#x2010;Engine, and Papin&#x02BC;s Digester&#x201D; in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SCIENTIFICDIALOGUES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Joyce, <i>Scientific Dialogues</i></a>,
                        2:232&#x2013;33), which also provides a summary of the poem. (<span class="persName-HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</span> suggested that 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s source lay solely in <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s summary, 
                        rather than in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s original poem 
                        &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#VILJOENPAPERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Helen Gill Viljoen Papers&#x201D;</a>, box D.V&#x005D;; 
                        however, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem engages with numerous specific details of diction in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s poem, 
                        which he could not have derived indirectly through <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>.)
            </p>
            
            <p>The Ruskins might have been interested, too, that <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span>&#x02BC;s coin press, its workings placed at the climax of 
                        <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s description, was operated by four boys of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s age. 
                        As critics have argued, however, the conditions of the laborers who operated such machinery are ignored in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s poetry, 
                        in which he causes the machines either to be driven by a dainty mythological crew or to seem to run themselves owing to intransitive verbs that allow for no other agency 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Priestman, <i>Poetry of Erasmus Darwin</i></a>, 93&#x2013;98). 
                        The operation of <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span>&#x02BC;s coin press is an exception to this obfuscation, in that the four boys are acknowledged in one of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        characteristically expansive prose notes to the poem; however, <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s purpose in highlighting the boys&#x02BC; industry in 
                        &#x201C;striking thirty thousand guineas in an hour&#x201D; in their <span class="placeName-SOHO">Soho</span> workplace, near <span class="placeName-BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</span>, 
                        is to award a &#x201C;civic crown&#x201D; to <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span> for having achieved 
                        &#x201C;such superior excellence and cheapness of workmanship, . . . as must totally prevent clandestine imitation, and in consequence save many lives from the hand of the executioner&#x201D;

            <p>In <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        appropriately positioned his poem at the head of the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</span></a>, 
                        which immediately follows <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</span></a>. 
                        The latter text draws verbatim on <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-lesson-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span> in order to supply Harry and Lucy with 
                        experiments. In fact, in chapters 8&#x2013;9 of <span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> hurries Harry through a series of experiments in pneumatics drawn from <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>, 
                        stopping just short of Conversation 40 on the steam engine, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> effectively 
                        replaces with his adaptation of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s poem on that topic. Thus, in terms both of structure and genre, the contents of 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span></a> can be viewed as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s extended version of 
                        an Edgeworthian, Joycean, and Barbauldian <a href="../notes/lesson_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">lesson</a>, 
                        which culminates in an ode to the industrial sublime (see also
                        <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1: Discussion</a>). In its rhetoric, this
                        structure appears related to <span class="persName-JJ">Joyce</span>&#x02BC;s tendency in the <span class="title-lesson-JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><i>Scientific Dialogues</i></span> to embellish his prose text 
                        with quotations from <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> and other poets of the British Enlightenment and scientific revolution.
            </p>
            
            <p>In <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s adaptation of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s lines, 
                        he somewhat reorders the sequence of topics in the original, using less figurative language but also elaborating <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s pictures 
                        in his own way (see the <span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/the_steam_engine_glosses.php" target="_blank">1</a></span> to the <span class="title-manuscript-MSI">MS I</span> witness). 
                        Like <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> begins with the engine draining water from mines to expose the ore. 
                        Next, appearing to have misunderstood <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        figurative account of a bellows that imprisons &#x201C;gales&#x201D; of forceful wind, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> substitutes a literal storm in lines 2&#x2013;3 of his poem, 
                        but in fact he has separated the figurative from its object, recurring to the bellows later in his list of useful applications of steam. 
                        Meanwhile, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intervenes in <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s sequence with steamboats, 
                        which rescue the victims of exploding steamboats&#x2014;an ironic anecdote that seems to bemuse <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                        and that effectively deflates the optimism of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s futuristic peroration, which predicts the wonders of steam transport. 
                        Three decades on, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> seems to know better than <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> whose aeronauts beckon from fanciful flying chariots. 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> corrects <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s anticipation of a time when steam shall &#x201C;drag the slow barge,&#x201D; 
                        remarking that the &#x201C;smokey barge &#x005B;is&#x005D; called by us steam boat.&#x201D;
            </p>
            
            <p>Nonetheless, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admits that steam is &#x201C;the most useful engine brought to man,&#x201D; 
                        and he returns to <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s list of wonders, if only to scramble its order again. 
                        Saving for later <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s pumps that fill cisterns and that pipe water to &#x201C;thirsty cities,&#x201D; 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> presses on to <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s steam&#x2010;powered millstones, 
                        which enchant him for <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s rhyme of <i>whirl</i> and <i>twirl</i> 
                        (thrice repeated by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>). He has no use 
                        for <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s pitch for grain&#x2010;based vegetarianism, preferring to keep up the &#x201C;twirling&#x201D; 
                        by introducing instead <span class="persName-SRA">Arkwright</span>&#x02BC;s cotton spinning machine. 
                        The action of revolving seems to take over <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem, as he continues with <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> 
                        to describe the round coins minted by <span class="persName-MB">Boulton</span>&#x02BC;s machine 
                        (here he is taken by another of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s rhymes, <i>squeeze</i> and <i>seize</i>); 
                        and he comes back to <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s water pumped to thirsty cities in order to 
                        send the water &#x201C;round the town&#x201D; and back again. Finally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> clenches these revolutions 
                        with an original contribution&#x2014;the picture of a chain that an engine has forged &#x201C;link to link&#x201D; and impressed with a floral design like a bracelet.
            </p>
            
            <p>Formally, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> borrows <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s heroic couplets without the pomposity of what 
                        <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span> condemns in the preface to <span class="title-anthology-LYRICALBALLADS"><i>Lyrical Ballads</i></span> 
                        as the artifice of poetic diction. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> catches <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s livelier rhyme words, 
                        and the poet&#x02BC;s energy and exuberance. Of course, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may simply have avoided a learnedness of diction that he did not understand 
                        at his young age; he shows a similar preference for poetic over pedantic terms in his
                        adaptation of <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SCIENTIFICDIALOGUES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Joyce, <i>Scientific Dialogues</i></a>,
                        in <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>. But <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        liked unusual words that could energize his writing; and perhaps the appeal for him of <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s poetry lay 
                        in the extraordinary fertility with which the poet invented words&#x2014;a major factor in the success of 
                        <span class="title-poem-"><i>The Botanic Garden</i></span>, as suggested by <span class="persName-DGK">D. G. King&#x2010;Hele</span> 
                        in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#DARWINMANOFIDEAS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Darwin, Man of Ideas and Inventor of Words&#x201D;</a> (pp. 165&#x2013;68). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may even have appreciated <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> for a quality that, in the poet&#x02BC;s own time, was a target 
                        for criticism&#x2014;his tendency to make &#x201C;every word picturesque,&#x201D; as <span class="persName-RS">Robert Southey</span> characterized his diction, 
                        or &#x201C;a succession of Landscapes or Paintings,&#x201D; as <span class="persName-STC">S. T. Coleridge</span> noted, 
                        to the extent that temporal connection and development seemed to suffer. <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s friend in the town where he practiced medicine, 
                        the poet <span class="persName-">Anna Seward</span>, the &#x201C;Swan of Lichfield,&#x201D; agreed with this appraisal, 
                        but she read <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span>&#x02BC;s spatial, rather than temporal, imagination and his sacrifice of &#x201C;intersticial space&#x201D; 
                        between pictures as a virtue (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Priestman, <i>Poetry of Erasmus Darwin</i></a>, 34). 
                        <span class="persName-ED">Darwin</span> may have helped form the taste on which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        would later base his critique of the pathetic fallacy.
