      <div class="title"><span class="persName-EDB">Edmund Butterworth (d. 1814)</span></div>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> held the post of writing master and accountant at the <span class="orgName-RHSE">Royal High School</span>, <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span>, 
                    the institution in which <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> enrolled in <span class="date-1795">1795</span> at age ten. 
                    <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> was appointed to the post in <span class="date-1780-08">August 1780</span> on the merits of &#x201C;the elegance of his penmanship&#x201D; and &#x201C;his success as a teacher,&#x201D; 
                    having previously taught writing and arithmetic <span class="date-1773-1780-08">since 1773</span> at <span class="orgName-DUMFRIESACADEMY">Dumfries Academy</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Steven, <span class="title-STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><i>History of the High School of Edinburgh</i></span></a>, 128; app. 6, p. 120). 
                    He proudly advertised his office on the title page of his first&#x2010;published copybook, <span class="title-book-BUTTERWORTHUNIVERSALPENMAN"><i>The Universal Penman; or The Beauties of Writing Delineated</i></span>, 
                    which appeared in <span class="date-1785">1785</span>, printed in <span class="placeName-EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</span> &#x201C;for the Author &#x0026; G. Robinson&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Heal, <span class="title-book-HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><i>English Writing&#x2010;Masters</i></span></a>, 25, 193). 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> would not have been instructed personally by <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span>, since the master resigned in <span class="date-1793-08">August 1793</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Steven, <span class="title-STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><i>History of the High School of Edinburgh</i></span></a>, app. 6, p. 120).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> must have brought unusual distinction to the post of writing master. Since the earliest days of the <span class="orgName-RHSE">Royal High School</span>, 
                    the class in writing had been considered optional at this institution devoted primarily to study of classics; 
                    and in <span class="date-1704">1704</span> the school authorities felt compelled to intervene in order to assure that the writing master was 
                    &#x201C;properly countenanced,&#x201D; by urging the Latin masters to &#x201C;use their best endeavours to get more constant employment to . . . the teacher of writing.&#x201D; 
                    The prestige of the post had not improved later in the century, when <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> was appointed to succeed an &#x201C;eccentric person&#x201D; who had deserted the school. 
                    Instruction in writing included basic arithmetic until <span class="date-1827-1828">1827&#x2013;28</span>, when greater dignity was bestowed on this part of the curriculum by combining its study with mathematics. 
                    This reform was part of an expansion and liberalization of the overall curriculum, although writing and arithmetic remained optional classes, allowing for students to obtain this instruction elsewhere 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Steven, <span class="title-STEVENEDINBURGHHIGHSCHOOL"><i>History of the High School of Edinburgh</i></span></a>, 80&#x2013;81, 128, 227).
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> designed his copybook, <span class="title-book-BUTTERWORTHUNIVERSALPENMAN"><i>The Universal Penman; or The Beauties of Writing Delineated</i></span>, according to its title page, 
                    for the &#x201C;improvement of youth&#x201D; and &#x201C;amusement of the curious&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Heal, <span class="title-HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><i>English Writing&#x2010;Masters</i></span></a>, 193). The main title, 
                    <span class="title-book-BUTTERWORTHUNIVERSALPENMAN"><i>The Universal Penman</i></span>, was shared with that of an older, well&#x2010;known copybook by <span class="persName-GBE">George Bickham</span> (1684&#x2013;1758) 
                    (see <a href="../notes/hand_note.php" target="_blank">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</a>). Nonetheless, another edition of <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span>&#x02BC;s text 
                    was published in <span class="date-1799">1799</span> in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> by <span class="orgName-LANDW">Laurie and Whittle</span> (p. 25). As was typical for publication of copybooks 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Becker, <span class="title-BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><i>Practice of Letters</i></span></a>, xiii), 
                    this firm was a print publisher specializing in maps, charts, 
                    and other pictorial prints. <span class="orgName-LANDW">Laurie and Whittle</span> also maintained a Hibernian connection, the firm being headed by the Scottish engraver, 
                    <span class="persName-RL">Robert Laurie</span> (1755?&#x2013;1836), who developed a method 
                    of printing colored mezzotints (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LAURIEDNB" target="_blank" class="inactive">Clayton and McConnell, &#x201C;Laurie, Robert (1755?&#x2013;1836&#x201D;</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>According to <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Heal, <span class="title-HEALENGLISHWRITINGMASTERS"><i>English Writing&#x2010;Masters</i></span></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-EDB">Butterworth</span> produced six additional titles by 1799&#x2013;1801, with the book that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> used, 
                    the <span class="title-book-BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><i>Young Arthmetician&#x02BC;s Instructor</i></span>, 
                    appearing in <span class="date-1805">1805</span>. In addition, the &#x201C;firm&#x201D; of <span class="orgName-EDBSON">Butterworth &#x0026; Son</span> 
                    produced &#x201C;several copy&#x2010;books from <span class="date-1800-1827">1800&#x2013;1827</span> and possibly later&#x201D; (pp. 25, 193). 
                    Thus, the firm remained in business in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, the year in which <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> purchased the 
                    <span class="title-book-BUTTERWORTHYOUNGARITHMETICIAN"><i>Young Arthmetician&#x02BC;s Instructor</i></span>, 
                    and also the year in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first used pen and ink and presumably began to learn round hand 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 168 n. 1; 
                        and see <a href="../notes/hand_note.php" target="_blank">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</a>).
