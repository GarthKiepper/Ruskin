      <p>The poet is now best remembered for his topographical poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, which in its illustrated edition of <span class="date-1830">1830</span> 
                    influenced <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s writing and ideas, from the <span class="date-1833-1834">1833&#x2013;34</span> 
         <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>, 
                    to the <span class="date-1843">1843</span> volume of <span class="title-book-JRMODERNPAINTERS1"><i>Modern Painters</i></span>. In the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth century</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was admired for other poetry, as well, especially his <span class="date-1792">1792</span> poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>The Pleasures of Memory</i></span>. 
                    He was also famous as a conversationalist and as a patron of artists and other writers. 
                    A wealthy and successful businessman&#x2014;he made his fortune in banking&#x2014;he could afford to craft his polite, formal verse slowly and methodically, 
                    and to promote the classical aesthetic and collecting to which he was fervently devoted. He was a Regency &#x201C;man of taste&#x201D; 
                    who survived into an increasingly earnest generation.
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s townhouse in <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span>, <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, 
                    where he hosted gatherings of artists and writers at his famous breakfasts and dinners, was a palace of art. The rooms were neoclassical in design; and like 
                    <span class="persName-THA">Thomas Hope</span> (<span class="date-1769-1831">1769&#x2013;1831</span>), with whom he shared ideas, 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> used his house to promote the aesthetic of neoclassicism. He commissioned furniture using <span class="persName-THA">Hope</span>&#x02BC;s Greek&#x2010; and Roman&#x2010;revival designs, 
                    and some interior features of <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> were copied directly from <span class="persName-THA">Hope</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="placeName-DUCHESSST">Duchess Street</span> house, 
                    a showcase that <span class="persName-THA">Hope</span> intended as a model for reforming British taste 
                    along neoclassical lines (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HOLCOMBCLASSICALTURNER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Holcomb, &#x201C;Neglected Classical Phase of Turner&#x02BC;s Art&#x201D;</a>, 406;

      </p>
      
      <p>The collection inside <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s museum&#x2010;like residence ranged from Greek and Roman antiquities, to Old Masters, 
                    to eighteenth&#x2010; and nineteenth&#x2010;century British art, to curious objects of virtu. The library was significant for manuscripts, prints, and drawings, 
                    including the complete drawings by <span class="persName-JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</span> (<span class="date-1755-1826">1755&#x2010;1826</span>) after 
                    <span class="persName-AEG">Aeschylus</span>, and the largest collection in the kingdom of drawings by 
                    <a href="../notes/stothard_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Thomas Stothard (1755&#x2013;1834)</a>, for whom <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> 
                    was a major patron. In his acquisition of paintings and sculpture, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> oversaw a small but representative collection that, 
                    as <span class="persName-ABJ">Anna Jameson</span> (<span class="date-1794-1860">1794&#x2013;1860</span>) commented, would serve better to educate a neophyte 
                    in the &#x201C;true comprehension of the characteristic excellences of various painters&#x201D; than would a larger and more imposing collection. Old Master paintings included works by 
                    Italian primitive and Renaissance (especially Venetian) artists; Baroque Flemish and Dutch artists; and landscapists, both classical Arcadian (e.g., <span class="persName-CLAUDE">Claude</span> 
                    and <span class="persName-NP">Poussin</span>) and Dutch. In British art, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s taste in figure and genre painting inclined to the modern 
                    with pieces by <span class="persName-RPB">Bonington</span>, <span class="persName-JHF">Fuseli</span>, <span class="persName-BRH">Haydon</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-CRL">Leslie</span>, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span>, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, <span class="persName-TSULLY">Sully</span>, and 
                    <span class="persName-DWC">Wilkie</span>; and in landscape, his preference leaned to the classical and Dutch&#x2010;inspired with examples by <span class="persName-TG">Gainsborough</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span>, <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, and <span class="persName-RWP">Wilson</span>

      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span> was particularly important to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s collecting and decorating, 
                    supplying not only works for the drawing and painting collections, but also illustrations for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s own books, 
                    and even objects of interior design. A cabinet painted by him depicted characters from <span class="persName-WSP">Shakespeare</span>, <span class="persName-GCP">Chaucer</span>, 
                    and <span class="persName-GBP">Boccaccio</span>, likely designed in the rococo, <span class="persName-JAW">Watteauesque</span> style 
                    that <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> had favored from his earliest book illustration commissions, and that he termed his <i>sans souci</i> manner 
                    of his <i>fÃªte galante</i> illustrations for the <span class="title-story-BOCCACCIODECAMERON">Decameron</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bennett, <i>Thomas Stothard</i></a>, 9&#x2013;10, 24&#x2013;25, 53&#x2013;55;

                    <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s working relationship with <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was established as early as <span class="date-1794">1794</span>, 
                    when the artist supplied a few cuts for an edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>The Pleasures of Memory</i></span>, followed by much more profusely illustrated editions of this 
                    and other poems, many of these editions published by the firm of <span class="orgName-CADELLTHOMAS">Thomas Cadell</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#COXHEADSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Coxhead, <i>Thomas Stothard, R.A.</i></a>, 120&#x2013;29). 
                    The artist and patron shared political sympathies, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> having been apprenticed in his youth to <span class="placeName-SPITALSFIELD">Spitalsfield</span> radicals and, 
                    as a young artist, formed close friendships with <span class="persName-JFSCULPTOR">John Flaxman</span> and <span class="persName-WBP">William Blake</span> (<span class="date-1757-1827">1757&#x2010;1827</span>) 
                    and admired <span class="persName-JBA">James Barry</span> (<span class="date-1741-1806">1741&#x2010;1806</span>) and <span class="persName-JHM">John Hamilton Mortimer</span> (<span class="date-1740-1779">1740&#x2010;79</span>); 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s associations included some of these artists, as well as influential <span class="orgName-WHIG">Whig</span> politicians 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bennett, <i>Thomas Stothard</i></a>, 2&#x2013;6, 11&#x2013;12, 23&#x2013;24).
      </p> 
      
      <p>The house and collections were open to view by anyone with a respectable introduction, including the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    who was ushered to <span class="placeName-STJAMESPLACE">St. James Place</span> by the editor and poet, 
                    <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</a>. 
                    Nothing is known about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first encounter with this arbiter of taste and host of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> literary and artistic life, 
                    apart from what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself later related about the incident in the autobiographical writing, 
                    <span class="title-essay-JRMYFIRSTEDITOR"><i>My First Editor: An Autobiographical Reminiscence</i></span> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 34:96), 
                    and <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:93). 
                    Perhaps <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> gained <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s entr&#x00E9;e on the strength of the youth&#x02BC;s remarkable imitation 
                    of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, 
                    the <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>. 
                    <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> knew about <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s project, since he debuted the young poet in the annual, 
                    <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-periodical-"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span></a>, 
                    by publishing a version of poems drawn from the <span class="title-composite-JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</span> 
                    (see <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Thomas Pringle (1789&#x2013;1834)</a>; and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#MENTORS.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Discussion&#x2014;Mentors</a>.
      </p> 
      
      <p><span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s introduction of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> should be viewed in tandem 
                    with <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s recommendation of his son as a future poet to the Scottish poet and fiction writer, 
                    <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank">James Hogg (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</a>. 
                    It is possible that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> approached <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> with the intention 
                    of offsetting and correcting <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s introduction of the boy to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, 
                    as much as complementing that introduction, since <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> was a homelier and more approachable figure. 
                    Both introductions probably belong to <span class="date-1833-1834">1833&#x2013;34</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>In these earlier years, the significance of the <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> connection revolved around the poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, particularly 
                    the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition. <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> developed his poem over the course of several years. 
                    Basing its substance on his Continental tour of <span class="date-1814-1815">1814&#x2013;15</span>, he started composition in <span class="date-1818">1818</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1822">1821&#x2013;22</span>, he published <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1822"><i>Italy, a Poem: Part the First</i></span> with the publisher, <span class="orgName-LONGMAN">Longman</span>, keeping the authorship anonymous 
                    (although the secret was exposed, to anyone who cared to investigate, by previous piecemeal appearance of portions of the work under <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s name, 
                    such as the lines on <span class="placeName-PAESTUM">Paestum</span>, released in <span class="date-1819">1819</span> and <span class="date-1822">1822</span>). 
                    In <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> released the poem under his name in a new edition published by <span class="orgName-MURRAY">John Murray</span>, 
                    which expanded and revised the contents of the <span class="orgName-LONGMAN">Longman</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1822"><i>Part the First</i></span>. 
                    Additionally, the first part went into a third edition, <span class="date-1823">1823</span>; and a fourth edition, with revisions, additions, and two woodcuts by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, <span class="date-1824">1824</span>. 
                    These constant revisions and reissues can be explained in terms of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s perfectionism, which he was able to satisfy by means of his enormous wealth, 
                    and not necessarily in terms of the indifferent reception of the poem, as has sometimes been alleged. While <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was unlucky to begin composing a long verse work about <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span> just at the same time when 
                    <span class="persName-GGB">Lord Byron</span> wrote and published the fourth canto of <span class="title-poem-BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><i>Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</i></span> (<span class="date-1818">1818</span>), 
                    in which the more famous poet laid claim to <span class="placeName-VENICE">Venice</span> as a popular topic for verse, 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem did sell respectably. <span class="persName-CP">Cecilia Powell</span> has found a figure of 1,250 copies sold by <span class="date-1823-04">April 1823</span>, according to a ledger of that date in the <span class="orgName-MURRAY">John Murray</span> archive; 
                    and while this figure seems earthbound compared to the stratospheric sales of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-SCOTTLADY"><i>Lady of the Lake</i></span> 
                    (20,000 copies in the first six months alone of <span class="date-1810">1810</span>) or <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-BYRONCORSAIR"><i>Corsair</i></span> 
                    (10,000 copies on the first day of publication alone in <span class="date-1814">1814</span>), <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s figure does not suggest a failure  
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</a>, 2&#x2013;3, 11, 12 n. 6;

      </p>
      
      <p>In <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> at last released <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY1828"><i>Italy, a Poem: Part the Second</i></span>, 
                    this part also published by <span class="orgName-MURRAY">Murray</span>, and illustrated by four woodcuts by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>. 
                    Within that same year, the poet bought up and destroyed the roughly two thousand unsold copies of both parts 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSJOURNAL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italian Journal</i></a>, 109&#x2013;10;

                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</a>, 2&#x2013;3, 11 n. 9, 12 n. 14). 
                    The Ruskin family numbered among the exceptional, albeit not exclusive, owners of these earlier editions of the poem, having puchased a copy in 
                    <span class="date-1828">1828</span>&#x2014;presumably of the second part of the poem, issued in that year 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 1:188 n. 4). 
                    What happened were rapid changes in the literary market, which are instructive about the context in which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began to publish his poetry.
      </p>
      
      <p>Whether <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> made a bonfire of the earlier editions of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                    because he was dismayed by the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, reviewers having largely treated it coolly or ignored it altogether, 
                    or because he was eager to publish a new, combined and revised version of parts 1 and 2&#x2014;an extravagant approach to revision that was within his means&#x2014;his 
                    decision cannot have been unaffected by the precipitous change in conditions that had favored publication of poetry prior to the <span class="date-1826-1829">later 1820s</span>. 
                    As <span class="persName-LE">Lee Erickson</span> has argued, in the first two decades of the century, the prestige of British poetry as a genre was supported by an economy of papermaking that 
                    kept the price of books high, thus encouraging consumers to favor a genre that repaid repeated reading of shorter works. Correspondingly, poets advanced a poetics 
                    that singled out an audience of the fit though few. This economy changed abruptly with industrial improvements that cheapened paper as well as making mass print runs possible through stereotyping. 
                    Now publishers encouraged a variety of genres, especially prose genres, in order to appeal to an audience expanding in both numbers and breadth of social class 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Erickson, <i>Economy of Literary Form</i></a>, 19&#x2013;48). 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>, for all his refinement, elitism, and perfectionism&#x2014;indeed, in a certain respect by virtue of those traits&#x2014;was able 
                    to maintain the viability of his poem, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, by responding to the growing popular market 
                    as an entrepreneur. He did so by capitalizing on another technological innovation of the period, steel engraving, which made possible the mass production of the engraved image, 
                    and which in <span class="persName-LE">Erickson</span>&#x02BC;s view deflected what remained of the popular poetry market into the minor subgenre of light lyric, pictorial verse favored by the 
                    <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Erickson, <i>Economy of Literary Form</i></a>, 29&#x2013;31). The medium 
                    made possible two of the most widely distributed and steadily demanded illustrated books of the first half of the century, the 
                    <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, and the 
                    <span class="date-1834">1834</span> collected <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>While this achievement was owing to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s unusual ability to manage the fortunes of his poetry in revolutionary market conditions, 
                    and to sustain at least the appearance of elite consumer status attached to his poetry, the possibility that conditions of print and visual culture equally governed 
                    the reception of his poetry is suggested by the most ephemeral of the illustrated versions of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1824-10-1824-11">late 1824</span>, there appeared a version of part 1 of the poem, with 12 copper engravings by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                    published as the <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> for <span class="date-1825">1825</span>  
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</a>, 2; and 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HOLCOMBCLASSICALTURNER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Holcomb, &#x201C;Neglected Classical Phase of Turner&#x02BC;s Art&#x201D;</a>, 406 n. 2). 
                    This was not an edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s complete poem, but an adaptation accommodated to the printed artifact called a <i>pocket book</i>, 
                    which was an ephemeral publication combining features of an annual almanac with a diary or engagement calendar. The 
                    <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> was an up&#x2010;market example of this kind 
                    of publication, with the almanac material refined to focus on fashionable information such as tables of the members of the British royalty and other dignitaries. 
                    The role played by <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poem was to embellish the blank diary pages with brief verse extracts, 
                    illustrated by copper&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <span class="persName-TSP">Thomas Stothard</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> had been employed to illustrate the <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> 
                    since <span class="date-1783">1783</span>, prior to his first cuts for <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>Pleasures of Memory</i></span>. 
                    The artist drew on that poem to illustrate the pocket book for <span class="date-1808">1808</span>, and on <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSHUMANLIFE"><i>Human Life</i></span> for the <span class="date-1820">1820</span> issue 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#COXHEADSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Coxhead, <i>Thomas Stothard, R.A.</i></a>, 50&#x2013;54). 
                    The publisher, <span class="orgName-TBS">Thomas Baker</span> of <span class="placeName-SOUTHAMPTON">Southampton</span>, appears to have relied on <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> 
                    to impart the qualities that made this pocket book stand out in the market and maintain unusual longevity&#x2014;the thematizing of each annual issue around a work 
                    of popular British literature, sometimes classic, but most often modern. The literary illustrations were limited to twelve vignettes, each less than one by two inches, 
                    and each one heading the first of a two&#x2010;page spread of diary pages for a given month. Quotations from the literary work were limited to brief captions, 
                    effectively forming part of the vignette itself. Working within these limitations, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> pictorially serialized such hefty works 
                    as novels and long narrative poems by <span class="persName-OG">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="persName-WCP">Cowper</span>, <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-GCRABBE">Crabbe</span>, <span class="persName-TCAMPBELL">Campbell</span>, and <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>.

                    Evidence is unclear about what part, if any, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> himself played in the adaptation of 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and his other poems to this ephemeral form of print culture 
                    (<span class="persName-AMH">Adele Holcomb</span> asserts that he commissioned the pocket&#x2010;book vignettes 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HOLCOMBCLASSICALTURNER" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Neglected Classical Phase of Turner&#x02BC;s Art&#x201D;</a>, 406&#x005D;). 
                    Later, in <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> admitted that his publisher, <span class="persName-EM">Moxon</span>, 
                    had not asked his permission to issue the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and the 
                    <span class="date-1834">1834</span> <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span> 
                    in four&#x2010;shilling monthly parts, so that consumers of modest means could afford to acquire these elegant books 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MERRIAMMOXON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Merriam, <i>Edward Moxon</i></a>, 45).
      </p> 
      
      <p>The convergence in period and style of the pocket books and the annuals suggests how elements of print culture in itself helped to staged the success 
                    of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s illustrated poems in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. 
                    Fashionable pocket books flourished from the <span class="date-1770-1799">final three decades of the eighteenth century</span> through the 
                    <span class="date-1800-1850">first half of the nineteenth century</span>, with such features as small engraved illustrations and almanac tables likewise offered 
                    by the early <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">illustrated literary annuals</a>, which emerged in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> probably commenced designing vignettes for the book&#x2010;length illustrated 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> as early as <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, 
                    only one year after the appearance of the pocket&#x2010;book version of the poem with its small vignettes by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</a>, 3). 
                    Yet the <span class="date-1825">1825</span> <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span>, which proved to be the last&#x2010;produced 
                    of this long&#x2010;running pocket book, presents two significant differences compared to earlier issues, which suggest a greater authorial presence: 
                    <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> substituted architectural scenes for his usual figure illustrations, a subject more like <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s; 
                    and <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s text was placed more on a par with the illustrations, rather than serving merely as a prompt for the pictures. 
                    Whereas earlier layouts reduced the literary source to a series of brief captions to the pictures, the <span class="date-1825">1825</span> issue 
                    presented a facing&#x2010;page spread, with the verso embellished by an architectural vignette, and the facing recto (formerly blank, in earlier issues) presenting a text box 
                    containing a substantial verse extract, as compared with the mere captions incorporated into the illustrations for earlier issues 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JUNGILLUSTRATED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Jung, &#x201C;The Illustrated Pocket Diary&#x201D;</a>, 31).
      </p>
      
      <p>In the full integrity of its text, <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> became a best&#x2010;seller when 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s commissioned <a href="../notes/turner_j_m_w_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">J. M. W. Turner (1775&#x2013;1851)</a>, 
                    <a href="../notes/stothard_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Thomas Stothard (1755&#x2013;1834)</a>, 
                    <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Prout (1783&#x2013;1852)</a>, and other artists to supply designs for intaglio engraving in steel, 
                    for an edition published in <span class="date-1830">1830</span> by the firms of <span class="orgName-CADELLTHOMAS">Cadell and Davies</span> and <span class="orgName-MOXON">Edward Moxon</span>. 
                    The partnership was a boon for the young <span class="persName-EM">Moxon</span> (<span class="date-1801-1858">1801&#x2013;58</span>), whom 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> had recently set up in business, while <span class="persName-TCP">Thomas Cadell</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1773-1836">1773&#x2013;1836</span>) was a well established publisher. In <span class="persName-EM">Moxon</span>, 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> found an idealistic champion of poetry publication, at a time when the genre seemed all but universally pronounced unmarketable 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MERRIAMMOXON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Merriam, <i>Edward Moxon</i></a>, 17&#x2013;18, 23&#x2013;24, 29). 
                    In <span class="persName-TCP">Cadell</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> could rely on the experience of a publisher who for decades had successfully produced 
                    illustrated books for both modest and upper&#x2010;class consumers, and who was a longtime employer of <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> as an illustrator 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bennett, <i>Thomas Stothard</i></a>, 15). While no poet other 
                    than <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> could have borne the prohibitive publication expenses, the edition had recouped his investment by the 
                    <span class="date-1832-03-20-1832-06-21">spring of 1832</span>, when one of the nearly 7,000 copies thus far sold would have been inscribed for 
                    <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span> birthday gift, if <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                    is accurate about the story of this first encounter with <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSJOURNAL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <i>Italian Journal</i></a>, 111; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:79).
      </p>
      
      <p>So the well&#x2010;known story goes, although <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> himself expresses uncertainty in <span class="title-book-JRPRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span> 
                    whether he received the book for his <span class="date-1832">1832</span> or <span class="date-1833">1833</span> birthday. Even more surprisingly, 
                    as <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s accounts show, a copy of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                    was purchased only following the the family&#x02BC;s return from the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1833</a>, 
                    rather than prior to their departure (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 1:286 n. 1). 
                    This may have been an additional copy, however. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s birthday copy is said to have been a present from 
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s business partner, <span class="persName-HT">Henry Telford</span> (<span class="date-1790-1859">1790&#x2013;1859</span>), 
                    although the copy is not signed by him.
      </p>
      
      <p>While capitalizing on recent print technologies&#x2014;and perhaps governed by changing economy for poetry&#x2014;the innovations marking <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> lay in its techniques for preserving rather old&#x2010;fashioned 
                    elements of neoclassical design that suited the author&#x02BC;s taste and over which he exerted complete control, whatever may have been his involvement in the 
                    <span class="date-1825">1825</span> <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><i>Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i></span> that anticipated 
                    the book&#x02BC;s vignette&#x2010;style illustration. In the book&#x02BC;s design, as <span class="persName-JPSCHOLAR">Jan Piggott</span> suggests, 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s model was the page layout of vignette and text as found in  
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GOLDSMITHPARNELL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-book-GOLDSMITHPARNELLPOEMS"><i>Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell</i></span></a>, 
                    published by <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</span> (ca. <span class="date-1757-1830">1757&#x2013;1830</span>) at his <span class="orgName-SHAKSPEAREPRESS">Shakspeare Printing Office</span> in <span class="date-1795">1795</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Piggott, <i>Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</i></a>, 20).                     
                    In that edition, poems were decorated with headpiece and tailpiece engravings by <span class="persName-TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1753-1828">1753&#x2013;1828</span>) and <span class="persName-JBE">John Bewick</span> (ca. <span class="date-1760-1795">1760&#x2013;95</span>). 
                    In the illustrated <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span>, the headpieces typically feature <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s landscapes, 
                    and the tailpieces illustrate narrative episodes with <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s figures. The effect could not be achieved using the older technologies 
                    employed by the Bewicks, however, since they engraved in wood, producing relief blocks that could be set along with the type, whereas steel engraving was an intaglio process. 
                    To achieve the neoclassical design using updated technology, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s printers devised a method for passing sheets through the press twice, 
                    once for caputuring the intaglio engraving, and once again for taking impressions from the relief type. The intaglio impression was taken first, 
                    and in such a way that the plate registration mark would be cut away with the trimmed pages

      <p><span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> exercised authoritarian control over the design and execution of every illustration, just as he obsessively revised almost every poem 
                    for the new edition (and persisted in developing <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and other works for future editions of his poetry). 
                    <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> decided on the subjects of the illustrations and their treatment, and he demanded subtle alterations in their execution, 
                    even if the laborious steel engraving was already underway. The artists and engravers were compliant, with <span class="persName-">Turner</span> relinquishing his dramatic instincts 
                    for the sake of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s neoclassicism, and allowing <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s figures to be placed in his landscapes,

                    Even the printer may not have escaped <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s supervision, since was known at times to descend on printshops, where he 
                    &#x201C;stirred up everybody with a long stick&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MERRIAMMOXON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Merriam, <i>Edward Moxon</i></a>, 28 n. 15). 
                    As critics have also remarked, however, if <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> was exacting in his demands, he and his collaborators were sympathetically well matched in their approach to the subject. 
                    <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s cheery representation of childhood and his idealized view of feminine grace clearly appealed to <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s taste 
                    as a collector and a writer (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BENNETTSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bennett, <i>Thomas Stothard</i></a>, 31&#x2013;35); 
                    and <span class="persName-">Turner</span>, while sharing <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s reverence for the antiquity of <span class="placeName-ITALY">Italy</span>, 
                    shrewdly offset his patron&#x02BC;s tendency to mire his poetry in historical pedantry, and instead complemented the poems with topographical interest that the poet neglected 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSOUTH" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, <i>Turner in the South</i></a>, 132&#x2013;34;

      </p>
      
      <p>The result is a happy collaboration of writer and artists that both embodies the technological advances and the changing literary markets of the <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>, 
                    while also defying the odds presented by those markets with an outstanding success. The <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> 
                    seems to pass judgment on the technologies that it exploits, as compared with the gaudy shallowness of the book&#x02BC;s cousins, the steel&#x2010;engraved 
                    <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">annuals</a>. Its typography referenced the beautiful typeface used for the 
                    <span class="orgName-SHAKSPEAREPRESS">Shakspeare Press</span> edition of <span class="persName-OG">Goldsmith</span>&#x02BC;s and <span class="persName-TPPOET">Parnell</span>&#x02BC;s poems, 
                    a face designed for <span class="persName-WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</span> by <span class="persName-WMT">William Martin</span> (). 
                    Its engraving, worthy of the Bewicks&#x02BC; skill, was undertaken by <a href="../notes/goodall_edward_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Edward Goodall (<span class="date-1795-1870">1795&#x2013;1870</span>)</a>, 
                    who managed to reproduce <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>&#x02BC;s exquisitely delicate atmospheric effects in spite of the hard, stubborn, and unforgiving medium of steel. 
                    In <span class="date-1834">1834</span>, the success was repeated with a collected edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSPOEMS1834" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i></a>, likewise jointly issued by the firms of 
                    <span class="orgName-CADELLTHOMAS">Cadell</span> and <span class="orgName-MOXON">Moxon</span>, and illustrated by additional engraved vignettes 
                    after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> and <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>. Sadly, <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span> 
                    died in the year of publication, after lingering for several months incapacitated by the effects of an accident.
      </p>
      
      <p>By <span class="date-1847">1847</span>, shortly before revolutions on the Continent must have made <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s Grand Tour poem seem quaintly dated, 
                    the combined sales of the two illustrated volumes, the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> and the 
                    <span class="date-1834">1834</span> <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span>, is estimated to have reached 50,000 copies 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSOUTH" target="_blank" class="inactive">Powell, <i>Turner in the South</i></a>, 136). 
                    According to <span class="persName-JRH">J. R. Hale</span>, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> considered the <span class="date-1834">1834</span> edition 
                    of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> to be the &#x201C;first complete&#x201D; version of the work 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROGERSJOURNAL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Rogers, <span class="title-periodical-ROGERSJOURNAL"><i>Italian Journal</i></span></a>, 128); 
                    however, <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span> appears to have continued to oversee editions of his poems, adding notes and possibly making further small refinements to the poems. 
                    <span class="persName-JRH">Hale</span> identifies editions of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> published in 
                    <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, <span class="date-1842">1842</span>, and <span class="date-1852">1852</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HALEROGERSTHEPERFECTIONIST" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hale, <span class="title-essay-HALEROGERSTHEPERFECTIONIST">&#x201C;Samuel Rogers the Perfectionist&#x201D;</span></a>, 65).
      </p>
      
      <p>The bibliography of these later editions remains to be exhaustively described, and versions of all of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s poems require collating. 
                    (The identity of the &#x201C;complete&#x201D; <span class="date-1834">1834</span> edition&#x201D; of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> is elusive. 
                    The illustrated poem continued to be bound separately from the <span class="date-1834">1834</span> <span class="title-book-ROGERSPOEMS1834"><i>Poems</i></span>. 
                    In a two&#x2010;volume edition of the paired works held by the <span class="orgName-UCLAL">library of the University of California, Los Angeles</span>, the volume of 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> carries a title page with the <span class="date-1835">1835</span>. 
                    Its contents appears identical to that of the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> edition, whatever variants might be discoverable in the individual poems and prose pieces.) 
                    In <span class="date-1839">1839</span>, a new illustrated edition of <span class="title-poem-ROGERSITALY"><i>Italy</i></span> appeared &#x2014;whether 
                    on the initiative of the author, or the publisher <span class="orgName-MOXON">Moxon</span>, or both&#x2014;which used woodcuts based on earlier designs by <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>, 
                    as well as new designs by <span class="persName-AWC">A. W. Callcott</span> (<span class="date-1779-1844">1779&#x2013;1844</span>), 
                    <span class="persName-EHL">Thomas Uwins</span> (<span class="date-1782-1857">1782&#x2013;1857</span>),

                    for the late <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s designs were engraved in part by <span class="persName-LCENGRAVER">Luke Clennell</span> 
                    (<span class="date-1781-1840">1781&#x2013;1840</span>), who had apprenticed under <span class="persName-TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</span>, 
                    and who had engraved <span class="persName-TSP">Stothard</span>&#x02BC;s drawings for an <span class="date-1810">1810</span> edition of <span class="persName-SR">Rogers</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    <span class="title-poem-ROGERSPLEASURES"><i>Pleasures of Memory</i></span>, but the remaining designs were cut by 
                    <span class="persName-JTENGRAVER">John Thompson</span> (<span class="date-1785-1866">1785&#x2013;1866</span>), who would later contribute to
