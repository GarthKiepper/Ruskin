                <p>As the result of Ruskin's first direct experience of the Alps, gained during the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833">Tour of 1833</ref>, 
                    his writing about the mountains is often generalized and literary in origin. The trope of first sighting frames the sublime spectacle of the distant Alps, 
                    which are understood as a "barrier" both between nations on earth and between planes of earthly and spiritual existence. One influential source of these tropes for Ruskin 
                    was the poem <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title> in <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> by

                    As explained in connection with another important first-sighting poem for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>,

                    Ruskin fails to specify which range of the Alps he first saw illuminated by the setting sun, leading to speculation later by both himself and critics about what would in fact have been visible 
                    from a vantage point above the town of Schaffhausen.</p>
                <p>Respecting certain kinds of sublime experience, the specific chain of the Alps that travelers first sighted would not have mattered. The Nonconformist clergyman, 
                    <persName corresp="#TRAFFLES">Thomas Raffles</persName> (<date notBefore="1788" notAfter="1863">1788&#x2013;1863</date>), first viewed the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                    from a height near <geogName corresp="#LADOLE">Dole</geogName> in the <geogName corresp="#JURA">Jura</geogName>--an approach through France to the western Alps, 
                    a chain that would have been invisible to the Ruskins approaching the mountains from the north in Germany. Nonetheless, Raffles was moved to pious reflections, 
                    which he expressed using tropes similar to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s:</p>

                            <p>[T]he carriage suddenly stopped, and the postilion cried out, <hi rend="italic">There&#x02BC;s <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName>! 
                                There are the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>!</hi> I started from a deep reverie into which I had fallen, and lifting up my eyes, beheld the whole chain of 
                                <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, forming the line of the horizon, at the immense distance of one hundred and thirty miles, and yet distinctly seen 
                                with the naked eye. <geogName corresp="#MONTBLANC">Mont Blanc</geogName> appeared towering above them all, and glittering in the sunbeams like a crystal lake. 
                                The emotions of my mind at that moment were unutterable. I had not power to speak&#x2014;my heart beat with increased rapidity within my bosom&#x2014;and 
                                now that the sublime and stupendous objects, upon which my imagination had dwelt so long and with so much ardour,were actually before me, I could scarcely realize the scene, 
                                or believe the vision true. And, indeed, there was something so unearthly in their appearance&#x2014;distance, and the splendours of a summer noon had so melted and 
                                softened them down&#x2014;that they looked like a singular combination of dark and brilliant clouds resting on the earth; while the suddenness and unexpectedness of their appearance, 
                                all contributed to heighten the effect, and give it more the air of enchantment than reality. You may smile, perhaps, that I should make so much of what 
                                some would deem a very little thing, and occupy so many lines in telling you where and when I first saw the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>. But if there are any scenes 
                                that interest me, next to the important discoveries of the sacred volume, they are the sublime and beautiful in nature&#x2014;such objects as surround me now, 
                                and such as are to feast my eyes and fill my heart, if life and health are spared, through the ensuing week. The man who does not kindle at these displays of the 
                                <persName type="scriptural_person" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>&#x02BC;s power&#x2014;that has no spirit stirring in his breast to harmonize and mingle with them, 
                                had better stay in cities, and study man! But I am happy sometimes to escape from <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, to study <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>&#x2014;and amidst her awful 
                                or her lovely scenes, to converse with God. I send you a sketch of the scenery to which I have now alluded. It was committed immediately to paper, while the outline was before me. 
                                It has the merit of correctness, therefore, though I am well aware it is destitute of every other.</p></div>

                <p>In such an approach to "the amazing barrier", specific geographical references are nearly consumed in the spiritual fire of Dantean and Miltonic language for Paradise; 
                    and Ruskin's innovation on Rogers's <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> is to substitute this spiritualized idea of the Alps 
                    for the borne of Italy that draws the speaker toward the ultimate goal of the journey. Although Ruskin left the Account unfinished, he clearly meant to locate 
                    that ultimate destination in the Chamonix valley overlooked by Mont Blanc, as proven by the spiritual experiences described in the essays

                    and others.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that, on this first major Continental tour, Ruskin failed to learn the names in various languages of famous peaks such as Mont Blanc, Mont Rigi, and Monte Rosa--or 
                    for that matter, of heights in the Siebengebirge along the Rhine, or in what portions of the Apennines the family crossed. In the Account, he started to employ the names of the Alpine ranges, 
                    as well, but mainly in order to gesture at the vast scope of the entire chain. In <title type="book" corresp="#EBELTRAVELLERSGUIDE"><hi rend="italic">The Traveller&#x02BC;s Guide through Switzerland</hi></title> 
                    by <persName corresp="#JGE">J. G. Ebel</persName>, which may have served as his first reference for these names (not his geography textbook,

                    which lists only the heights of the greatest mountains around the world), Ruskin learned that the "ancient appellations of the Alps have been preserved, to the present day, 
                    as they were in the time of the Romans", and he learned to measure the scope of the chain rhetorically, using such sweeping word lists as this:</p>

                            <p>The Alps, properly speaking, extend from the borders of the Rhone, in the south of France, to the frontiers of Hungary, a space of twelve degrees of longitude. 
                                They traverse Provence and Dauphin&#x00E9; in France; the whole of Savoy; a great part of Pi&#x00E9;mont; 
                                and, in the new Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, the Milanese, the Venetian states; again the whole of Switzerland, the Tyrol, Salzbourg, 
                                Carinthia, Carniola, Styria, Croatia, Sclavonia, the southern parts of Bavaria, 
                                Swabia, and of Austria. In breadth they are from two to four degrees of latitude.</p>

                <p>Thus, in the two ranges named in the Account, the Rhetian Alps and the Dinaric Alps, Ruskin appears to have selected the names to express extreme distances.

                    filling "the whole of the Grisons and of Tyrol, and serv[ing] as boundaries to Germany, also to Milanese and Venetian Lombardy"

                    extending along the left bank of the Danube to Sophia, as Ebel says, to become "confounded with the <hi rend="italic">Balkan</hi>, or mont <hi rend="italic">Hemus</hi>, which reaches the Black Sea"
