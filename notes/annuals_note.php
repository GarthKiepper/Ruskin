      <p>Annuals were anthologies of verse, short fiction, and pictures&#x2014;the latter typically reproduced by engraving&#x2014;which were intended to serve as gifts and tokens of friendship. 
                    Combining literary and pictorial interest, the annuals were essentially ekphrastic collections, 
                    in that they tended to privilege pictures, and situated writing in relation to a picture in some fashion. 
                    Often, writers were hired to write to an engraving, rather than the artist illustrating existing tales or verse, 
                    just as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed his poem, <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;<span class="title-poem-SALTZBURG">Saltzburg</span>&#x201D;</a> in response to an engraved view of the city. 
                    As a form of gift publication, the annuals were published toward the end of a given year, 
                    typically in November in time for the holiday season of Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s; hence, their titles named the year following that of their actual publication. 
                    For example, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> first appearance in an annual was in the volume entitled 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for MDCCCXXXV</i></a>, 
                    which went to press as early as <span class="date-1834-08">August 1834</span>, to be available for purchase before <span class="date-1834-12">December</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <i>Thomas Pringle</i></a>, 244). 
                    The annuals first emerged in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, quickly becoming a distinctive feature of early Victorian print culture, 
                    and they were widely popular with the middle and upper classes by the time <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> began publishing in them in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>.

         <span class="head-section">History and Development</span>
         
         <p>The first British annual was <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, published by the firm of <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span> in <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, for the holiday season of <span class="date-1822-11-1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-RAP">Rudolf Ackermann</span> (<span class="date-1764-1834">1764&#x2013;1834</span>) as a publisher&#x2014;putting aside his many other interests and entrepreneurial successes&#x2014;was known primarily for his high quality, extravagant topographical books, 
                        usually illustrated by brightly hand&#x2010;colored aquatints. For the <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> hit upon a successful blend 
                        of polite and sentimental verse, tales, and engraved illustration aimed at middle&#x2010; and upper&#x2010;class consumers, especially women, 
                        who already formed the primary audience for the <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span> firm&#x02BC;s in&#x2010;house magazine, 
                        the <span class="title-periodical-REPOSITORYOFARTS-italic">Repository of Arts</span> (<span class="date-1809">1809</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1828">28</span>). 
                        The magazine&#x02BC;s editor, <span class="persName-FS">Frederic Shoberl</span> (<span class="date-1775-1853">1775&#x2013;1853</span>), did double duty as the editor of the <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ford, <i>Ackermann</i></a>, 70, 64&#x2013;65, 80&#x2013;83).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>According to <span class="persName-AR">Anne Renier</span>, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> based his creation on a combination of two models, the German <i>Taschenbuch</i>, and the British &#x201C;pocket book.&#x201D; 
                        The former kind of publication offered the literary contents and illustration for which the British annuals became known, 
                        whereas the latter kind were familiar to British consumers as supplying tables of useful information along with blank or illustrated pages for the owner&#x02BC;s memoranda 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Renier, <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 5&#x2013;6). 
                        To this ancestry of the annual, <span class="persName-KDH">Katherine Harris</span> adds the printed traditions of the emblem book and the almanac, 
                        as well as the homemade fashions of the lady&#x02BC;s album and the scrapbook, which were compiled by hand for personal collecting, 
                        although the cover and blank pages may have been manufactured 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Harris, <span class="title-essay-HARRISBORROWING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</span></a>).
                        (Some confusion of terms arises from the similarity between the German <i>Taschenbuch</i> 
                        and the English <i>pocket book</i>, both terms referring to the publications&#x02BC; portable size, 
                        but the German form was literary, whereas the English <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> pocket book was akin to the almanac and diary.)
                    
         </p>
         
         <p><span class="date-1701-1800">Eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> pocket books resembled almanacs by including reference information, especially tables of facts that were deemed appropriate 
                        for fashionable readers, such as lists of the members of the British royalty, the crowned heads of Europe, and names of other dignitaries. 
                        This convention appealed to <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span>, since he marketed his books and art supplies primarily to leisured and wealthy clientele, 
                        and accordingly the first <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> included a &#x201C;General Summary of Houses, Families, and Persons in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Great Britain</span>, in <span class="date-1821">1821</span>,&#x201D; along with tables of other demographic 
                        information about <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>, <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. 
                        This first British annual also reflected the original use of the pocket book as an engagement calendar,   
                        presenting a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, reproduced from copper engravings 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JUNGSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Jung, <span class="title-essay-JUNGSTOTHARD">&#x201C;Print Culture, Marketing, and Thomas Stothard&#x02BC;s Illustrations for <i>The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i>, 1779&#x2013;1826&#x201D;</span></a>, 31;

                        and see the facsimiles of <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> available in

         </p>
         
         <p>After the first <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, the <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span> firm dropped the almanac features; and according to <span class="persName-KDH">Katherine Harris</span>, by <span class="date-1825">1825</span> 
                        all annuals had abandoned presentation of fashionably useful information in favor of strictly literary and pictorial contents 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Harris, &#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</a>, 7).
                        Nonetheless, the annuals reflected lasting legacies of the pocket book, characteristics that point to the original uses of the earlier ephemeral print items. 
                        One legacy was the publication schedule of pocket books, which were released on the market in the autumn for purchase as Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s presents. 
                        Pocket books, like modern calendars, usually lost value after the beginning of the New Year, 
                        and it was to avoid this obsolescence that the almanac material was dropped from the early annuals 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hunnisett, <i>Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</i></a>, 139). 
                        For example, in an early volume of the annual, <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>, the editor, <span class="persName-TKH">T. K. Hervey</span>, 
                        announced his intention to remove &#x201C;all those features which marked&#x201D; the publication &#x201C;as more peculiarly adapted 
                        for one season of the year than another&#x201D; and to raise the production above the annuals&#x02BC; &#x201C;toy&#x2010;like attributes&#x201D; 
                        (, vi).
                        Nonetheless, the annuals retained the pattern of publishing in the autumn of one year a title that was meant &#x201C;for&#x201D; the following year. 
                        Thus, the first <i>Forget Me Not: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <span class="date-1823">1823</span></i> was published in <span class="date-1822-10">October 1822</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ford, <span class="title-bibliography-FORDACKERMANN"><i>Ackermann</i></span></a>, 65).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>Another legacy of the pocket book was consumers&#x02BC; perception of this niche of print culture as representing elegant, but not costly mementos. 
                        In the case of a shrewdly produced and marketed pocket book, 
                        such as <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS-italic">The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</span> (<span class="date-1779">1779</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1826">1826</span>), the ephemeral publication could anticipate the literary annual 
                        by being turned into permanent keepsakes. The publisher commissioned sophisticated, historical&#x2010; or literary&#x2010;themed engravings that were worth preserving, 
                        and the pocket book was available in a range of bindings, from functional to elegant. 
                        Owners, too, transformed the ephemeral publication into a keepsake, by dedicating the diary pages to memoranda more lasting than notes about engagements, 
                        and in some cases by decorating copies with precious handmade coverings, presumably to serve as personal gifts 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JUNGSTOTHARD" target="_blank" class="inactive">Jung, <span class="title-essay-JUNGSTOTHARD">&#x201C;Print Culture, Marketing, and Thomas Stothard&#x02BC;s Illustrations for <i>The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</i>, 1779&#x2013;1826&#x201D;</span></a>, 34&#x2013;36). 
                        With the addition of embellishments to the diary pages, such as the vignettes on literary themes heading the otherwise blank pages of the 
                        <span class="title-periodical-ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS-italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</span>, pocket books of this class were produced well into the <span class="date-1801-1900">nineteenth century</span>, 
                        and they even began themselves to feature literary content in response to&#x2014;and even anticipating&#x2014;the impact of the annuals 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JUNGILLUSTRATED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Jung, <span class="title-essay-JUNGILLUSTRATED">&#x201C;The Illustrated Pocket Diary&#x201D;</span></a>, 25, 33, 36; 
                        and see <a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Rogers (<span class="date-1763">1763</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1855">1855</span>)</a>).
                    
         </p> 
         
         <p>When adapting features of the <i>Taschenbuch</i> from his native <span class="placeName-GERMANY">Germany</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> drew on the popular Gothic and sentimental emphasis in these publications. 
                        As <span class="persName-KDH">Harris</span> has discovered, <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> modeled the <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> 
                        more closely than he acknowledged on a particular <i>Taschenbuch</i>, the <span class="title-periodical-VERGISSMEINNICHT-italic">Vergissmeinnicht</span>, edited by 
                        <span class="persName-HC">Heinrich Clauren</span> (<span class="persName-HC">Karl Heun</span>, <span class="date-1771">1771</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1854">1854</span>), 
                        whose popular story, &#x201C;<span class="title-prose-MIMILI">Mimili,</span>&#x201D; appeared in the <span class="title-archive-HARRISFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> for <span class="date-1824">1824</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRISBORROWING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Harris, <span class="title-essay-HARRISBARROWNING">&#x201C;Borrowing, Altering, and Perfecting the Literary Annual Form&#x201D;</span></a>, 14&#x2013;16).
                        Based on the proven success of these formulas, the popularity of these first volumes of <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> proved so overwhelming  
                        that the <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span> firm diverted a major share of its resources into the books&#x02BC; production, 
                        consequently relinquishing experiments with lithography, 
                        a new method of reproducting images that the firm had recently helped to introduce to <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>. 
                        <span class="persName-RAP">Ackermann</span> turned over the opportunity to develop the new technology to <span class="persName-CH">Charles Hullmandel</span> (see 
                        <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.php" target="_blank">Samuel Prout (<span class="date-1783">1783</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1852">1852</span>)</a>). 
                        Ackermann&#x02BC;s success and increased production immediately inspired other publishers to enter the field with their own annual. The first imitator was 
                        the firm of <span class="orgName-RELFE">Lupton Relfe</span>, whose 
                        <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a> 
                        appeared in <span class="date-1823">1823</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1824">24</span>; 
                        and the second was <span class="orgName-RH">Hurst, Robinson</span>, 
                        whose <span class="title-periodical-LITERARYSOUVENIR-italic">Literary Souvenir</span> appeared in <span class="date-1824">1824</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1825">25</span>. 
                        The latter was edited for a decade by the energetic <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Alaric Watts</span> (<span class="date-1797">1797</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1864">1864</span>).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>Hereafter, as shown in the &#x201C;Chronological Index of British Literary Annual Titles&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Harris, ed., <i>&#x201C;Forget Me Not&#x201D; Archive</i></a>), 
                        new annuals proliferated exponentially, surviving the depression in the book trade caused not only by the panic of <span class="date-1826">1826</span> but also the Reform agitation 
                        of <span class="date-1826">1832</span>. While all this effort could be summed up by the poet laureate, <span class="persName-RS">Robert Southey</span> 
                        (<span class="date-1774">1774</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1843">1843</span>), as &#x201C;picture&#x2010;books for grown children&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Renier, <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 12&#x2013;13), 
                        the ekphrastic connection between picture and text was profoundly significant to the audiences&#x2014;child and adult, alike&#x2014;of the unfolding 
                        <span class="date-1837-06-20-1901-01-22">Victorian Era</span>. 
                        For example, copies of the three most important founding titles 
                        of the genre&#x2014;<span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>, and the <span class="title-periodical-LITERARYSOUVENIR-italic">Literary Souvenir</span>&#x2014;were owned by 
                        the Brontë family, and it was the pictorial appeal of annuals that most influenced the siblings&#x02BC; imaginations 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ALEXANDERBRONTEANNUALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Alexander, &#x201C;&#x2018;That Kingdom of Gloom&#x2019;&#x201D;</a>, 414&#x2013;18). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was captured by an engraving after <a href="../notes/turner_j_m_w_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span> (1775&#x2013;1851)</a>, &#x201C;<span class="title-engraving-TURNEREHRENBREITSTEINIMAGE">Ehrenbreitstein</span>,&#x201D;

         <p>Some successful aspects of marketing of the annuals, such as their time&#x2010;consuming method of <a href="#STEELENGRAVING">steel engravings</a> 
                        and their extravagant <a href="#BINDINGS">bindings</a>, ultimately proved the undoing of the annuals. 
                        For some publishers, the high cost of production, often combined with an expensive pursuit of celebrated contributors, became unsustainable by the <span class="date-1840-1849">1840s</span>, 
                        and the annuals died out altogether by the <span class="date-1860-1869">1860s</span>

                        After the reign of the annuals had passed, the later Victorians found it easy to mock the often run&#x2010;of&#x2010;the&#x2010;mill contents of these publications, 
                        which alternated between simpering sentiment and melodramatic horror, but the grown&#x2010;up Victorians could not so easily escape the influence of the annuals&#x02BC; images 
                        over their imagination in youth.

         <p>One great significance of <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-periodical-LITERARYSOUVENIR-italic">Literary Souvenir</span> lay in the introduction of steel engraving to the annuals&#x2014;that is, 
                       intaglio printing from a steel plate. Typically, the steel plate was covered with an etching ground, 
                       which was engraved by an etching needle in preparation for etching by acid, and then the image was further worked using a burin. 
                       Because steel is much harder than copper, its durability increased the viability of print runs to the thousands of impressions, 
                       compared to the few hundreds of impressions possible from a copper plate, 
                       which rapidly wore thin from the abrasion of wiping

                       While copper rapidly yields lighter and dimmer impressions, its more pliable surface is easier to engrave than stubborn steel; 
                       and therefore innovations were required to make steel practicable for this use, 
                       such as softening the steel for engraving and then hardening the plate. 
                       With these developments, the art grew rapidly in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>

         <p>In book illustration, 
                       the literary annuals were among the first kinds of publications to profit from the new technique.

                       producing fine results in the second year of <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts&#x02BC;s</span> editorship. 
                       Unfortunately, the success coincided with the financial panic of <span class="date-1826">1826</span>, 
                       which brought down many publishers, including <span class="orgName-RH">Hurst, Robinson</span>, yet <span class="persName-AWEDITOR">Watts</span> kept the <span class="title-periodical-LITERARYSOUVENIR-italic">Literary Souvenir</span> 
                       afloat under his own proprietorship as well as editorship. Payments to authors were not always substantial or regular, except in the cases of lavish fees offered to the most celebrated

         <span class="head-section">Bindings</span>
         
         <p>Another feature of the annuals that set apart these publications as especially desirable consumer items was their rich bindings. 
                        The first annuals were covered with glazed paper boards that were printed with a design framing the title, 
                        and the volumes were protected by a slipcase of the same materials and printed design. By the 
                        <span class="date-1827-1829">final quarter of the 1820s</span>, these paper and cloth bindings were being outdone by silk, 
                        which was regarded as not only a luxurious and feminine material but also as supplanting the need for a slipcase. 
                        In <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, however, all this showiness was trumped by 
                        <a href="../notes/friendships_offering_note.php#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING" target="_blank"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 
                        which announced itself as newly acquired by the firm of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> by boasting embossed leather boards. 
                        As Eleanore Jamieson explains in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</a>, 
                        the stylized patterns used in embossed covers like that for

                        were called <i>arabesque</i>, incorporating floral and other pictorial elements. The arabesque pattern 
                        was distinguished from <i>cathedral</i> patterns, which were associated with devotional publications. 
                        A cheaper alternative means of embossing was to employ 
                        <i>engine&#x2010;turned</i> designs, resulting in the fine&#x2010;lined ornaments developed originally for bank notes. 
                        But by the <span class="date-1827-1829">final quarter of the 1820s</span>, arabesque designs could as well be produced by machine 
                        (pp. 10&#x2013;13, and see 7&#x2013;14). 
                        Indeed, the flamboyance, yet relative inexpensiveness, of these bindings, which anticipate the ornate fancifulness 
                        achieved in the heyday of Victorian bookbinding, 
                        the <span class="date-1860-1879">1860s&#x2013;70s</span>, indicates how suddenly factory modes of production had transformed a cottage industry 
                        that, at the start of the nineteenth century, had remained essentially unchanged for centuries

         <span class="head-section">The Landscape Annual</span>
         
         <p>A special class of the annual was the <i>landscape annual</i>. The emergence of this subclass, when viewed from the perspective of the 
                        <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>, can be understood as a project by a star entrepreneur of steel engraving,

                        with the founding of one of the earliest, showiest, and longest surviving of the annuals, the <i>Keepsake</i> 
                        (<span class="date-1828-1857">1828&#x2013;57</span>). 
                        From the annual&#x02BC;s beginnings in <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> showcased engravings after <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>, 
                        and in the same year <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> also published

                        for which the engraver commissioned and purchased 120 watercolors by <span class="persName-JMWT">Turner</span>. 
                        In <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, <span class="persName-CTH">Heath</span> and his editor for the <i>Keepsake</i>, 
                        <span class="persName-FMR">Frederic Mansel Reynolds</span> (ca. 1800&#x2013;1850), 
                        journeyed personally to the <span class="geogName-SCOTTISHBORDERS">Scottish borders</span> and the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span>, 
                        aiming to solicit contributions from the celebrated poets associated with these landscapes, <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span>,

         </p>
         
         <p>The enticement of this class of annuals for the Ruskin family can be measured by an episode in <span class="date-1832">1832</span>, when the idea was floated 
                        of producing a new deluxe edition of <span class="title-collected_poems-THEQUEENSWAKE-italic">The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</span> (<span class="date-1813-1819">1813&#x2013;19</span>) as a charitable scheme supporting the Scottish poet,

                            <span class="persName-JH">Hogg</span> urged that the gift book &#x201C;should be a work something like The Keepsake&#x201D; with landscape illustrations by

                            &#x201C;so as to make it a drawing&#x2010;room book.&#x201D;  
                        To this effort, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> subscribed generously 
                        with a donation of &#x00A3;20, pleading for the honor of being listed as the first subscriber

                        It is significant that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> sent the donation on <span class="date-1832-02-08">8 February 1832</span>, 
                        his son&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1832-02-08">thirteenth birthday</span>, when the boy is believed to have received another

         <p>At the same time, viewed in a longer perspective, 
                        the landscape annual can be situated in the broader context of travel writing and illustration, 
                        in which the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape annuals formed a stage between the British copper&#x2010;engraved topographical and antiquarian magazines 
                        published <span class="date-1770-1819">between the last three decades of the eighteenth century and first two decades of the nineteenth</span>, 
                        and the magazines promoting the etching revival <span class="date-1870-1899">in the final three decades of the nineteenth century</span> 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ROBERTSBRITISHARTPERIODICALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Roberts, &#x201C;British Art Periodicals of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries&#x201D;</a>, 3&#x2013;4). 
                        In this context, for the Ruskins, the landscape annuals belong to the category of topographical 
                        poetry and prose, such as <i>Italy</i> by 
                        <a href="../notes/rogers_samuel_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-SR">Samuel Rogers</span> (1763&#x2013;1855)</a>; 
                        pictorial travelogues, with or without letterpress, such as 
                        <span class="title-collected_sketches-PROUTSKETCHES-italic">Facsimiles of Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany</span> by 
                        <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span> (<span class="date-1783">1783</span>&#x2013;<span class="date-1852">1852</span>)</a>; 
                        and <a href="../notes/travel_narratives_and_guidebooks_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Travel Narratives and Guidebooks</a>. 
                        Topographical poetry, travel narrative, and landscape illustration were often included in annuals that were not specifically landscape annuals; 
                        an example is <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> own first contribution to an annual, the poem 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</a>, published in <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>. 
                        Unlike the illustrated literary annuals, however, which typically 
                        anthologized a miscellany of verse and prose along with illustrations of both landscapes and figures, which were contributed by a variety of writers and artists, 
                        the landscape annuals featured a single artist paired with a single writer of the letterpress. Although subordinated to the artist, 
                        the writer for a landscape annual could, like <span class="persName-LR">Leitch Ritchie</span>, 
                        see himself as contributing &#x201C;<i>bona fide</i> sketches of his own&#x201D; 
                        (qtd. in  <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hunnisett, <i>Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</i></a>, 147).

         <p>Another illustrated publication of the period, one that shared the medium of steel engraving with the annuals, but not their fancy bindings, 
                        was the collected edition of poetry or prose by a British author, gathered into uniformly bound volumes, which were solidly but inexpensively produced. 
                        The Ruskins had first&#x2010;hand experience of these editions in the <i>magnum opus</i> of <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>&#x003E;, 
                        which started the trend, and they witnessed the failed attempt by 
                        <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> (ca. <span class="date-1770-1835">1770&#x2013;1835</span>)</a> 
                        to complete such an edition of the <span class="title-anthology-ALTRIVETALES-italic">Altrive Tales</span>. In order to economize, these editions featured only a few illustrations per volume, 
                        but publishers made up the deficiency by selling portfolios of prints, which collectors could bind either separately or along with the uniform edition in question
