      <div class="title">Richard Herne Shepherd (1840&#x2013;95)</div>
      
      <p><span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> compiled the first professional bibliography of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                    <a href="../notes/bibliography_of_ruskin_shepherd_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Bibliography of Ruskin</i> (1878&#x2013;81)</a>. 
                    He was among the early &#x201C;far&#x2010;sighted professionals&#x201D; who, in <span class="persName-JC">John Carter&#x02BC;s </span>estimation, helped steer the trend in 
                    <a href="../notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php" target="_blank">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>, since 
                    he compiled many of the first important bibliographies of these writers for collectors 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TASTEANDTECHNIQUE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Carter, <span class="title-book-TASTEANDTECHNIQUE"><i>Taste and Technique in Book&#x2010;Collecting</i></span></a>, 23;

                    In addition to the <a href="../notes/bibliography_of_ruskin_shepherd_note.php" target="_blank">Ruskin bibliography</a>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    compiled bibliographies of several other modern authors: <span class="persName-CJHD">Dickens</span> (<span class="date-1880">1880</span>), 
                    <span class="persName-WT">Thackeray</span> (<span class="date-1881">1881</span>), <span class="persName-TC">Carlyle</span> (<span class="date-1881">1881</span>), 
                    <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> (<span class="date-1887">1887</span>), <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> (<span class="date-1896">1896</span>), 
                    and <span class="persName-STC">Coleridge</span> (<span class="date-1900">1900</span>), the last two published posthumously. 
                    Although little more than handlists, rather than descriptive or analytical bibliographies in a present&#x2010;day sense, 
                    <span class="persName-RHC">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> publications aspired to exhaustiveness, 
                    and his thoroughness led him to uncover early writing by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> and others that was then little known.
      </p>
      
      <p>In addition to ferreting out modern authors&#x02BC; early work for bibliographical description, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> edited a wide range of juvenilia and youthful writing for
                    publication. In <span class="date-1866">1866</span> and <span class="date-1879">1879</span> (2d ed.), he published <span class="title-ana-TENNYSONIANA"><i>Tennysoniana</i></span>, 
                    which combines biographical narrative with extensive quotation in support of studying 
                    &#x201C;&#x2018;the growth of a Poet&#x02BC;s mind&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TENNYSONIANA" target="_blank" class="inactive">Shepherd, <span class="title-ana-TENNYSONIANA"><i>Tennysoniana</i></span></a>, v). 
                    Justifying the volume as preserving &#x201C;materials for such a study,&#x201D; materials that might otherwise be allowed to &#x201C;perish,&#x201D; <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> threads together commentary 
                    with liberal quotation from  <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</span> published early poetry, 
                    starting with <span class="title-collected_poems-POEMSBYTWOBROTHERS"><i>Poems by Two Brothers</i></span> (<span class="date-1827">1827</span>) and the <span class="placeName-CAMBRIDGEU">Cambridge</span> prize poem (<span class="date-1829">1829</span>), and continuing with poetry associated with the death of 
                    <span class="persName-AH">Arthur Hallam</span> and with later poetry. In <span class="date-1870">1870</span> and again in <span class="date-1875">1875</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    printed <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</span>&#x02BC;s early <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</i></span>, which the poet had suppressed. 
                    In <span class="date-1872">1872</span> (new ed., <span class="date-1878">1878</span>), he
                    reconstructed Charles and Mary Lamb&#x02BC;s <span class="title-collected_poems-LAMBSPOETRY"><i>Poetry for Children</i></span>, and, in <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of <span class="persName-EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span></i></span>. 
                    In the latter, Shepherd typographically reproduced <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</span> girlhood volume, <span class="title-anthology-BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><i>An Essay on Mind with Other Poems</i></span> (1826), 
                    and he filled out the reprint with the miscellaneous poems found in <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-collected_poems-PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><i>Prometheus Bound</i></span> volume of <span class="date-1833">1833</span>.(<span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    believed that <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><i>An Essay on Mind</i></span> was <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</span> earliest published volume, whereas it was in fact preceded in
                    <span class="date-1820">1820</span> by <span class="title-poem-THEBATTLEOFMARATHON"><i>The Battle of Marathon</i></span>. <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was correct, however, that the next volume to appear after <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGANESSAYONMIND"><i>An Essay on Mind</i></span> was
                    <span class="title-collected_poems-PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><i>Prometheus Bound . . . and Miscellaneous Poems</i></span>.) 
                    Also in <span class="date-1878">1878</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> collected <span class="title-collected_poems-HWLEARLYPOEMS"><i>The Early Poems of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</i></span>, and he included <span class="persName-TM">Moore&#x02BC;s</span> juvenilia, along with a
                    number of later fugitive pieces in <span class="title-collecte_poems-THOMASMOOREPROSEANDVERSE"><i>Prose and Verse . . . by Thomas Moore</i></span>. In <span class="date-1887">1887</span> came <span class="persName-WMT">Thackeray&#x02BC;s</span> turn, with recovery of <span class="title-anthology-THACKERAYSULTANSTORK"><i>Sultan Stork</i></span>
                    and other early sketches, which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> included in a republication of his bibliography of the novelist.
      </p>
      
      <p>In <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> facsimile editions of modern authors&#x02BC; works, the contents are dominated by juvenilia and youthful writing, 
                    doubtless owing in part to the appeal that the rarity of such items posed to collectors, and the opportunity that these scarce items afforded to a publishing market eager to serve collectors 
                    (see <a href="../notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php" target="_blank">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>). The
                    publisher of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> Lamb, Longfellow, and Blake editions, <span class="persName-BMP">Basil Montagu</span>, was among the first to
                    cater to this collecting interest, listing first editions of <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> for sale 
                    as early as <span class="date-1870">1870</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TASTEANDTECHNIQUE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Carter, <span class="title-book-TASTEANDTECHNIQUE"><i>Taste and Technique in Book&#x2010;Collecting</i></span></a>, 22). Living authors 
                    were often indignant to find their earlier work resusitated, and both <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> and <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span> contested
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>&#x02BC;s publications as piracies. <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, who in <span class="date-1862">1862</span> 
                    had already sued a bookseller, <span class="persName-JCH">J. C. Hotten</span>, for sale of a piracy, <span class="title-collected_poems-POEMS18301833"><i>Poems, 1830&#x2013;1833</i></span>, 
                    compiled by <span class="persName-JDC">James Dykes Campbell</span> (<span class="date-1838-1895">1838&#x2013;95</span>)  
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FIRSTPIRATEDEDITION" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sinclair, &#x201C;First Pirated Edition of Tennyson&#x02BC;s Poems&#x201D;</a>), 
                    was irritated by <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-ana-TENNYSONIANA"><i>Tennysoniana</i></span> and in <span class="date-1866">1866</span> complained to 
                    the publisher, <span class="persName-BMP">Basil Montagu </span> that its publication was &#x201C;against my desire,&#x201D; having an &#x201C;infinite dislike to the 
                    sort of book about anyone&#x201D;; and he accused the book&#x02BC;s scholarship of inaccuracy (letter of <span class="date-1866-05-14">14 May 1866</span>, 
                    in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TENNYSONLETTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, <i>Letters</i></a>, 2: 436). 
                    Later, <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> drew the line when he learned that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    had printed a transcript of the Laureate&#x02BC;s early poem, <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</i></span> (composed 1827&#x2013;28), 
                    in <span class="date-1870">1870</span> and again in <span class="date-1875">1875</span>. In 
                    <span class="date-1875-1876">1875&#x2013;76</span>, the poet adopted legal proceedings and won an injunction against 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> pirating activities connected with the <i>Tale</i> 
                    and some other poems, although, on learning that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was poor, <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> 
                    himself paid the court costs with which the defendant was charged 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Paden, &#x201C;Tennyson&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale </i></span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>, and <span class="persName-TJW">Wise</span>,&#x201D;</a>, 119&#x2013;24; 
                    as a legitimate publication, the text existed only as a scarce <span class="date-1833">1833</span> pamphlet, 
                    originally printed by the poet at his own expense and for private circulation only, 
                    <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> having decided to remove the poem from the manuscript of his <span class="date-1832">1832</span> <span class="title-collected_poems-TENNYSON1832POEMS"><i>Poems</i></span> published by <span class="persName-EM">Edward Moxon</span> &#x005B;ibid., pp. 112&#x2013;13&#x005D;).
      </p>
      
      <p>While <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> admitted his guilt and full responsibility for the <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> piracy, 
                    the episode points to a larger issue respecting the extent of writers&#x02BC; authority to control access to texts and their 
                    varying states versus collectors&#x02BC; desires to possess and study 
                    scarce publications, authorized or otherwise. In <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</span> case, his objections appear to have 
                    extended beyond a legitimate concern to protect an unpublished (if printed) poem 
                    to a belief that authorial control was absolute, that an author&#x02BC;s revision or 
                    suppression of a work obviated the public&#x02BC;s right to curiosity about 
                    previous states of that work. Even scholarly examination of his influences provoked the poet&#x02BC;s scorn and anxiety, as when he famously demeaned 
                    <span class="persName-JCC">John Churton Collins</span> (1848&#x2013;1908) as a &#x201C;Louse upon the Locks of Literature&#x201D; for having published such scholarship 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#EDMUNDGOSSE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Thwaite, <i>Edmund Gosse</i></a>, 295&#x2013;97; 
                    <span class="persName-JCC">Collins&#x02BC;s</span> also compiled an edition of <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson&#x02BC;s</span> revised and suppressed early poems, 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#EARLYPOEMSTENNYSON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Collins, <span class="title-collected_poems-EARLYPOEMSTENNYSON"><i>Early Poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson</i></span></a>). 
                    Despite this intimidating reaction, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> remained undaunted in supplying &#x201C;materials for . . . study&#x201D; of &#x201C;&#x2018;the growth of a Poet&#x02BC;s mind,&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    a purpose that, he declared, 
                    trumps both popular opinion of the value of such materials and authors&#x2019; authority over their dissemination (when there is no legal obstacle in copyright): 
                    &#x201C;A poet himself, or the relations of a poet, may not . . . always be the best or the final judges of what should continue to hold a place in the collection of his writings.&#x201D; 
                    Even if the literary value of a given early work seems doubtful, &#x201C;the study of &#x005B;a poet&#x2019;s&#x005D; mind and work should be left to the scholar to decide, not to the poet&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s Earlier Poems&#x201D;</a>, 722).
      </p>
      
      <p>With these latter, defiant remarks, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> renewed his cause in the face of opposition by <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span>. 
                    In <span class="date-1876">1876</span>, 
                    only months after <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span> won his suit against <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> for pirating 
                    <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</i></span>, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> appealed to the editors of the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> to take his part by 
                    opposing the announced publication of another of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> reprints, 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1826&#x2013;1833</i></span></a>. 
                    (<span class="persName-RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</span> grudge, besides being driven by the hostility, which he shared with <span class="persName-ALT">Tennyson</span>, to what poets deemed to be piracies of their work, 
                    may have been intensified by <span class="persName-RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</span> chagrin that it was his copy of the original <span class="date-1833">1833</span> pamphlet 
                    of <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</i></span> that was sold in <span class="date-1870">1870</span> to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> 
                    publisher, <span class="persName-BMP">B. M. Pickering</span>, thereby supplying the copytext for the piracy 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TENNYSONSHEPHERDWISE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Paden, &#x201C;Tennyson&#x02BC;s <span class="title-poem-TENNYSONLOVERS"><i>The Lover&#x02BC;s Tale</i></span>, Shepherd, and Wise,&#x201D;</a>, 113&#x005D;. 
                    Paden does not mention whether <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> was aware of this connection. Another score that <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> wished to settle with <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> arose from the latter having stolen 
                    a march on <span class="persName-RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</span> publisher by releasing a portion of &#x201C;Herv&#x00E9; Riel&#x201D; obtained from an early draft of the poem 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BROWNINGSTESTIMONY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Honan, <span class="title-essay-BROWNINGSTESTIMONY">&#x201C;Browning&#x02BC;s Testimony&#x201D;</span></a>, 29&#x005D;.) 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> later acknowledged in court that he incited the journal&#x02BC;s attack on <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span>, 
                    although he testified that he did not himself author the journal&#x02BC;s squib and disclaimed knowledge of the writer&#x02BC;s identity 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BROWNINGSTESTIMONY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Honan, &#x201C;<span class="title-essay-BROWNINGSTESTIMONY">Browning&#x02BC;s Testimony</span>&#x201D;</a>, 28&#x2013;29). 
                    It must have been <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span>, however, who provided the journal with its key argument opposing the reprint&#x2014;namely, that 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> violated the wishes of the late poet, <span class="persName-EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</span>, 
                    who had specifically suppressed the feature text of the proposed republication. 
                    <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="date-1833">1833</span> translation of <span class="persName-AEG">Aeschylus&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND1833"><i>Prometheus Bound</i></span> was effectively placed out of bounds, 
                    the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> maintained, when <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span> published a new translation of the play in <span class="date-1850">1850</span>. 
                    While the journal ventured an opinion that <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span> had no legal remedy against <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> reprinting of his late wife&#x02BC;s publication, 
                    the journal strongly asserted an ethical opprobrium in <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> taking the &#x201C;liberty to defy the wishes of the dead, and to outrage the feelings of the living&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPNOV76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Literary Gossip&#x201D;</a>, 25 November 1876, 690).

      <p>In <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> reply to this charge, relayed by the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> in its <span class="date-1876-12">December 1876</span> issue, 
                    the editor conceded republication of the earlier Aeschylus translation. 
                    &#x201C;It was never my intention,&#x201D; <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> declared&#x2014;surely disingenuously, as the journal remarked&#x2014;&#x201D;to reproduce the earlier draught of the 
                    version of the &#x2018;<span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND1833">Prometheus</span>&#x2019; (<span class="date-1833">1833</span>) for which a better and more mature 
                    translation was afterwards substituted.&#x201D; <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> refused, however, to abandon his right to reprint the original poems that, in the original <span class="date-1833">1833</span> volume, follow 
                    the <span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND1833"><i>Prometheus Bound</i></span> translation. As already quoted, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> claimed the authority of the scholar over that of the poet and the poet&#x02BC;s relations; and he persisted: 
                    &#x201C;The poems have been fully given to the world, and are now among the world&#x02BC;s possessions.
                    Poetical students will not allow them to die, however indifferent the general
                    public may be to them&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878">Earlier Poems</span>&#x201D;</a>, 722). 
                    While the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> contested <span class="persName-RHC">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> right to the shorter poems as well, 
                    and in the coming months repeatedly impugned his honesty, the journal was probably unjustified in attributing the editor&#x02BC;s motives solely to greed. 
                    In other instances, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was not timid about upholding the claims of scholarship against the mere assertion of power by literary men with intimidating reputations. 
                    For example, in the <span class="date-1867-1900">later nineteenth-century</span> revival of <span class="persName-WBP">William Blake,</span> <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> was unique among editors 
                    in his insistence on a &#x201C;historical&#x201D; (i.e., diplomatic) approach to the texts. In contrast, the Rossetti brothers, 
                    <span class="persName-WMR">William Michael</span> and <span class="persName-DGR">Dante Gabriel,</span> &#x201C;practiced emendation&#x201D; of <span class="persName-WBP">Blake&#x02BC;s</span> texts that amounted to wholesale rewriting. They made free with the texts in the belief 
                    that such an approach was justified by the view of <span class="persName-WBP">Blake</span> as vatic, heroic, and individualistic, 
                    a Carlylean representation of the poet advocated by the <span class="persName-WBP">Blake</span> biographer, <span class="persName-AGB">Alexander Gilchrist</span> (1828&#x2013;61). 
                    In lonely opposition to this powerful current of opinion forming <span class="persName-WBP">Blake&#x02BC;s</span> reputation, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> stood up for the integrity of the text over an assertion of control by any author, living or dead: 
                    &#x201C;<span class="persName-DGR">Mr. &#x005B;D. G.&#x005D; Rossetti</span> (though sanctioned by Mr. &#x005B;Algernon&#x005D; Swinburne) has no more right,&#x201D; <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> pronounced, 
                    &#x201C;to alter <span class="persName-WBP">William Blake&#x02BC;s</span> poems than <span class="persName-JEM">Mr. &#x005B;John Everett&#x005D; Millais</span> would have to paint out some obnoxious detail of medievalism in a work of Giotto or Cimabue&#x201D;&#x2014;<span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    strategically turning the Pre-Raphaelites&#x02BC; own historicist stance against them 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BLAKEPOEMS1874" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-collected_poems-BLAKEPOEMS1874"><i>Poems of William Blake</i></span></a>, xiv; and see 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#DORFMANBLAKE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Dorfman, <i>Blake in the Nineteenth Century</i></a>, 65&#x2013;110).
      </p>
      
      <p>When <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1826&#x2013;1833</i></span></a> 
                    appeared in  or , the reprint did omit 
                    the <span class="date-1833">1833</span> translation of <span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND1833"><i>Prometheus Bound</i></span>. In the introduction to the edition, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    justifies the omission in terms compliant with <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning&#x02BC;s</span> objections&#x2014;namely, that 
                    the translation had been &#x201C;replaced by the authoress in later years by an entirely new version.&#x201D; To this admission, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> adds the value judgment that 
                    &#x201C;to re&#x2010;produce the earlier crude attempt &#x005B;at translation&#x005D; or the girlish preface that 
                    accompanied it&#x201D; would not be &#x201C;wise or desirable.&#x201D; <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> thus entangles himself in contradiction, 
                    by referring to criteria of &#x201C;crudeness&#x201D; and &#x201C;girlishness,&#x201D; which justify suppression of some juvenilia, 
                    while declaring that the other selections from <span class="title-collected_poems-PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><i>Prometheus Bound . . . and Miscellaneous Poems</i></span>, which he does reprint, 
                    are &#x201C;in no sense immature, or unworthy of the genius of the writer.&#x201D; At the same time, 
                    the introduction contains a passage nearly identical to one that, in his December <span class="date-1876">1876</span> reply to the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> a year earlier, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    had pleaded in defense of the study of poets&#x02BC; youthful writing: 
                    &#x201C;The &#x2018;exquisite touch&#x2019; that &#x2018;bides in the birth of things&#x2019; is peculiarly apparent in the bursting of bud and leaf of a new poetic genius. 
                    The summer of its manifestation may have greater fervour, and richer pomp and majesty of foliage, but about its early spring there must always be a nameless and peculiar charm&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1826&#x2013;1833</i></span></a>, vii&#x2013;viii; 
                    and see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s Earlier Poems&#x201D;</a>, 722). This florid metaphor, 
                    in which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> manifestly retained his faith, is consistent with his declarations elsewhere of a mission to make available the juvenile materials 
                    for studying the &#x201C;growth of a poet&#x02BC;s mind.&#x201D; According to the metaphor, these materials do not consist in Wordsworthian spots of time 
                    remembered from the youth&#x02BC;s experience of nature; rather, the metaphor figures the precocious child genius <i>as</i> nature, 
                    and her or his early publications (or, presumably, manuscripts) as the material witness of this bursting into bud and leaf.
      </p>
      
      <p>In <span class="date-1877-12">December 1877</span>, the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> carried a review of the <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span> reprint. 
                    The writer has been identified as <span class="persName-TWD">Theodore Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> (<span class="date-1832-1914">1832&#x2013;1914</span>; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WMROSSETTILETTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">W. M. Rossetti, <i>Selected Letters</i></a>, 374&#x2013;75), 
                    a solicitor turned man of letters, who became poetry critic for the journal, and who would later appoint himself caretaker of <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne,</span> in order to rescue that poet&#x02BC;s mind from his infantile body, wrecked by alcoholism and self&#x2010;abuse. 
                    In the review, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> tasks <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> as a &#x201C;bookseller&#x02BC;s hack&#x201D; who, &#x201C;devoid&#x201D; of &#x201C;literary taste,&#x201D; 
                    &#x201C;must be called a bibliographer, . . . by dint of that enormous patience which often accompanies a dearth of intelligence,&#x201D; 
                    and which makes him &#x201C;really learned in editions and in variations of texts&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></a>, 765&#x2013;66). 
                    This contempt for the editor of reprinted early works and compiler of &#x201C;variations of texts,&#x201D;&#x2014;a sneer detectable in the tone even of 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> newspaper obituary, which pronounced him &#x201C;a great authority upon the various editions, with their additions and emendations, of the works&#x201D; 
                    of modern authors (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SHEPHERDOBITUARY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned obituary of Richard Herne Shepherd</a>)&#x2014;must have sprung from a culturally significant animus, 
                    one that prompted <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> to feel warranted in using such intemperate language. 
                    As a solicitor, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> would have been interested in questions of copyright raised by the reprint. 
                    (One wonders if he authored the journal&#x02BC;s initial <span class="date-1876">1876</span> volley against the planned reprint, a paragraph informed by a legal opinion: &#x201C;were it a question of tables or chairs, 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Mr. Browning</span> could defend the wishes of his wife; but in the case of poems, 
                    our wise laws give him no remedy&#x201D; &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPNOV76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Literary Gossip&#x201D; &#x005B;25 November 1876&#x005D;</a>, 690&#x005D;. 
                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> would have been in a position to advise the journal, having joined the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> staff only months earlier, in July <span class="date-1876">1876</span> 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WATTSDUNTONLIFE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hake and Compton-Rickett, <i>Life and Letters of Theodore Watts-Dunton</i></a>, 1: 237&#x005D;.) 
                    Questions of copyright aside, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> uses a figure comparing <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> to an &#x201C;insect,&#x201D; which echoes a characterization by <span class="persName-WMR">William Michael Rossetti,</span> 
                    and which suggests that the animus of these men arose less from outrage over legal violation 
                    than from their indignation over what they perceived as <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> loss of professional caste. <span class="persName-WMR">Rossetti</span> characterizes <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> as a &#x201C;vampire,&#x201D; 
                    the figure suggesting a parasitical feeding on the corpus of the author. The contempt appears to center in a perception of the reprint editor as violating the author&#x02BC;s integrity and possession of self. 
                    What&#x02BC;s worse, the reprint editor poses a particularly degrading, subordinate form of parasitical exploitation, since the editor works for a publisher. 
                    <span class="persName-WMR">Rossetti</span> struggles to elaborate this figure for the editor of &#x201C;early poems&#x201D; and &#x201C;forgotten works&#x201D; in a way that pushes the editor sufficiently low in the food chain: 
                    &#x201C;To be one&#x02BC;s own vampire is an unenviable lot; to be somebody else&#x02BC;s vampire is a post to which only a torturous ambition could aspire.&#x201D; 
                    In another of <span class="persName-WMR">Rossetti&#x02BC;s</span> stretched analogies, the reprint editor combines the role of the &#x201C;chiffonier&#x201D; (i.e., ragpicker) with that of the &#x201C;resurrection-man&#x201D; (i.e., body snatcher) 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYREVIVALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Literary Revivals&#x201D;</a>, 331; Rossetti&#x02BC;s identity as author of this review noted in 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#WMROSSETTILETTERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">W. M. Rossetti, <i>Selected Letters</i></a>, 374&#x2013;75).
      </p>
      
      <p>In the hands of <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</span> this characterization of Shepherd&#x02BC;s offense both descends into scurrilous abuse and is elevated to a challenge to Britain&#x02BC;s national interests. 
                    If <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> professed mission, according to his <span class="date-1876">1876</span> reply to the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>, 
                    was to serve the interests of &#x201C;poetical students&#x201D; regardless of the &#x201C;indifferen&#x005B;ce of&#x005D; the general public,&#x201D; or even of the opposition of the author and the author&#x02BC;s relations, 
                    in order to publish comprehensive materials for studying the growth of the poet&#x02BC;s mind 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s Earlier Poems&#x201D;,</a> 722), 
                    then the nation&#x02BC;s interests demand that the editor of modern authors&#x02BC; juvenilia and other &#x201C;literary revivals&#x201D; be put down. Exposed as a &#x201C;vampire&#x201D; and blood&#x2010;sucking &#x201C;insect,&#x201D; 
                    he must be denied autonomy, lest he exercise critical and creative authority over the writer, the writer&#x02BC;s family, and the nation. 
                    Thus, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</span> apparently perceived his mission in the review as ostracizing <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd,</span> separating him from the &#x201C;noble calling&#x201D; of legitimate commerce with men of genius. 
                    The reprint editor is relegated to the fringe of professional letters as a mere scavenger; 
                    such a person &#x201C;scans the book-stalls&#x201D; for &#x201C;some forgotten production, or some inchoate form of a known production of a famous writer,&#x201D; 
                    and then attaches himself to a publisher or bookseller willing to abandon &#x201C;the dignity of a noble calling&#x201D; 
                    (&#x201C;we wish to express our astonishment and regret that publishers <i>can</i> be found for such undertakings as this &#x005B;reprint of Barrett juvenilia&#x005D; and &#x2018;<span class="title-ana-TENNYSONIANA">Tennysoniana</span>&#x2019;&#x201C;). 
                    Such a pair as this fallen publisher and his hack, advancing the &#x201C;precocious smartness&#x201D; of juvenilia in place of poetic genius, deserves the contempt of the &#x201C;man of genius&#x201D; 
                    (and even the &#x201C;typical woman of poetic genius&#x201D;). Any respectable author who is &#x201C;about to print&#x201D; and embody his genius in a printed book will do well to 
                    &#x201C;pause and consider before he imperils his privileges as an English gentleman&#x201D; by succumbing to &#x201C;caterers of this kind&#x201D;

      <p>In <span class="date-1879">1879</span>, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> successfully brought suit for libel against the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> 
                    citing the attacks on his character in reviews not only of the <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning</span> reprint 
                    but also of his edition of <span class="persName-CL">Charles</span> and <span class="persName-ML">Mary Lamb&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-collected_poems-LAMBSPOETRY"><i>Poetry for Children</i></span>,

                    Doubtless <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> prevailed in his charge of libel given the cumulative effect of the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum&#x02BC;s</i></span> reviews, 
                    the <span class="date-1878-01-12">12 January 1878</span> notice

Pickering,</span> for misleading statements &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LAMBSPOETRY" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Lamb&#x02BC;s &#x2018;<span class="title-collected_poems-LAMBSPOETRY">Poetry for Children</span>&#x2019;&#x201D;</a>, 89&#x005D;.)
      </p>  
      
      <p>In the course of the libel trial, <span class="persName-RB">Robert Browning</span> appeared as a witness for the defendant, <span class="persName-JFA">John Francis</span> (1838-1918), the editor of the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span>. 
                    In his testimony, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> reverted to the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum&#x02BC;s</i></span> initial (<span class="date-1876-11-25">25 November 1876</span>) objections 
                    to republication of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning&#x02BC;s</span> juvenilia, quoting remarks that perhaps he had himself originally dictated to the journal&#x2014;namely, 
                    that <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> reprint defied the personal wishes of &#x201C;writers of eminence,&#x201D; living and dead 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPNOV76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Literary Gossip&#x201D;</a>, <span class="date-1876-11-25">25 November 1876</span>, 690). 
                    <span class="persName-EBB">Browning</span> informed the court: &#x201C;&#x2018;<span class="persName-EBB">Mrs. Browning</span> would herself, had she been alive, have objected to the republication 
                    of her earlier poems&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;not only the translation of 
                    <span class="title-drama-PROMETHEUSBOUND1833"><i>Prometheus Bound</i></span> but also of &#x201C;'all her earlier poems&#x02BC;&#x201D;; &#x201C;&#x2018;she was only fourteen years old when she wrote some of them.&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> was casting a net beyond even the contested shorter poems in the 1833 <span class="title-collected_poems-PROMETHEUSBOUNDANDMISC1833"><i>Prometheus</i></span> volume, to guard the entirety of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</span> juvenilia, 
                    his reference to the fourteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old poet extending the ban backward to <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett&#x02BC;s</span> first published volume, which <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> had overlooked&#x2014;the <i>Battle of Marathon</i> (1820). 
                    Therefore, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> urged, 
                    the defendant was not &#x201C;too strong&#x201D;&#x201D; in pronouncing <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> a man who arrogated the &#x201C;&#x2018;liberty to defy the wishes of the dead and to outrage the feelings of the living&#x2019;&#x201D;
                    (quotations in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BROWNINGSTESTIMONY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Honan, &#x201C;<span class="title-essay-BROWNINGSTESTIMONY">Browning&#x02BC;s Testimony</span>&#x201D;</a>, 28&#x2013;29).
      </p> 
      
      <p>Awkwardly for Browning, as <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> lawyer pointed out, 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> had acted seemingly analogously to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> 
                    in an <span class="date-1852">1852</span> edition of letters by <span class="persName-PBS">Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, published by <span class="persName-EM">Moxon</span>, 
                    for which <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> penned an introduction. 
                    Interestingly, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> anticipated the comparison, and even offered to read aloud the entire essay, which he had brought with him to court&#x2014;an offer 
                    that was deflected with laughter. (<span class="persName-RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</span> proposal seems less absurd when one realizes that, in <span class="date-1879">1879,</span> only a few privileged collectors had access to the introduction, 
                    the publisher, <span class="persName-EM">Moxon,</span> having destroyed most copies of the <span class="date-1852">1852</span> <i>Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</i> when the documents were revealed to be a forgery. 
                    <span class="persName-RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</span> introduction became widely available only in <span class="date-1881">1881</span> when <span class="persName-FJF">F. J. Furnivall</span> &#x005B;1825-1910&#x005D; published it in the <i>Browning Society&#x02BC;s Papers</i>, 
                    and it became known by its now familiar title, the <i>Essay on Shelley</i>. 
                     See the editorial notes by Donald Smalley on Browning, <i>Essay on Shelley</i>, in 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BROWNINGWORKS" target="_blank" class="inactive">King et al., ed., <i>Complete Works of Robert Browning</i></a>, 5: 350.) 
                    In the end <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> seems 
                    only to have helped the plaintiff&#x02BC;s case by admitting not only that he failed to seek the permission of <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley&#x02BC;s</span> living descendant before publishing the introduction, 
                    but that he had even recognized the <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley</span> letters as forgeries when he undertook the project 
                    (quotations in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BROWNINGSTESTIMONY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Honan, <span class="title-essay-BROWNINGSTESTIMONY">&#x201C;Browning&#x02BC;s Testimony&#x201D;</span></a>, 28&#x2013;29, 30).
      </p>
      
      <p>For <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> scholars, the more significant issue presented by this episode is <span class="persName-RB">Browning&#x02BC;s</span> confounding admission that he was aware that 
                    <span class="persName-EM">Moxon&#x02BC;s</span> edition consisted of forgeries of <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley&#x02BC;s</span> letters, 
                    a testimony that scholars have attempted to explain in a more flattering light consistent with the poet&#x02BC;s character. What is more to our purpose is the remark with which the rattled poet sought 
                    to redirect the cross&#x2010;examination to his principle point in having carried the <i>Essay on Shelley</i> into court. As <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> explained: 
                    &#x201C;&#x2018;My essay was on the character of <span class="persName-PBS">Shelley</span>, 
                    and I referred to these poems &#x005B;e.g., &#x201C;Queen Mab&#x201D;&#x005D; as those of an immature boyhood&#x201D;&#x2019; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BROWNINGSTESTIMONY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Honan, <span class="title-essay-BROWNINGSTESTIMONY">&#x201C;Browning&#x02BC;s Testimony&#x201D;</span></a>, 30). 
                    For <span class="persName-RB">Browning,</span> the immaturity of the poet settles the debate a priori respecting the value of the poems, 
                    just as <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> in his review of <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span> appeals to the &#x201C;common-sense&#x201D; of the &#x201C;judicious . . . British public&#x201D; 
                    in settling judgments of literary value of works that are likely to benefit the nation 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></a>, 765). 
                    By these &#x201C;common-sense&#x201D; standards, the poet maintains perpetual right over what&#x02BC;s in and what&#x02BC;s out, and <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> claims for the independent judgment of the critic are nowhere. 
                    The <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> incessantly reminded readers of a phrase tossed off by <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> in his <span class="date-1876">1876</span> reply to journal, 
                    his remark that he undertook his reprints for use by &#x201C;poetical students&#x201D; whose purposes would &#x201C;doubtless be <i>caviare</i>&#x201D; to &#x201C;&#x2018;the general&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LITERARYGOSSIPDEC76" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Mrs. Browning&#x02BC;s Earlier Poems&#x201D;,</a> 722). Seizing on the apparent elitism of the remark, 
                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> scoffed at a conception of the study of poetry that indulges &#x201C;'<i>caviare</i>' at the expense of all the common amenities of life&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></a>, 765).
      </p>
      
      <p>In taking this common&#x2010;sense stance, <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> avoided the implications of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> cheeky quotation of the poet himself, when arguing for the value of early writing. 
                    As testimonial to the &#x201C;nameless and peculiar charm&#x201D; to be discovered the &#x201C;bursting of bud and leaf of a new poetic genius,&#x201D; 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> quotes <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> on the &#x201C;&#x2018;exquisite touch&#x2019; that &#x2018;bides in the birth of things,&#x2019;&#x201D; a line from 
                    <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> (1872) 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1826&#x2013;1833</i></span></a>, viii). 
                    I have argued elsewhere that <span class="persName-RB">Browning</span> did eventually answer <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> more thoughtfully about his opponent&#x02BC;s appropriation from this poem, 
                    which meditates on how the poetic spirit engages with the material world. Here it is necessary to drive at the main point concerning the reception of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> poetics, 
                    which defended the value of a poet&#x02BC;s juvenile writing in understanding the growth of the modern poet&#x02BC;s mind&#x2014;albeit a poetics ever so slightly developed in <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> writing. 
                    Although the Wordsworthian tropes making up this hypothesis would have been more than familiar to every cultivated British reader by mid-century, 
                    <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> proposition of taking juvenilia seriously in the study of modern poetry provoked a furious reaction from the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> that demands understanding.
      </p>
      
      <p>Part of the disturbance appears owing to the recognition that, as already pointed out, <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> formulation is not quite Wordsworthian, in that the child&#x02BC;s genius is not remembered and translated 
                    through the poet&#x02BC;s mature inscription of spots of time, but rather directly communicated to the observer by the child writer. 
                    In the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum&#x02BC;s</i></span> review of <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> edition of the Lambs&#x02BC; <span class="title-collected_poems-LAMBSPOETRY"><i>Poetry for Children</i></span>, 
                    the writer dwells on <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth&#x02BC;s</span> paradigm of loss, which forms the &#x201C;inexplicable&#x201D; 
                    but &#x201C;impassable gulf&#x201D; between &#x201C;the adult mind and the mind of childhood&#x201D;: &#x201C;If it 
                    was by a sudden leap that we left behind us the &#x2018;heaven&#x2019; that &#x2018;lies about us in 
                    our infancy&#x2019;&#x2014;if we lost at one stoke all that sense of the wonderfulness of the 
                    wonderful, the beauty of the beautiful&#x2014;all that intense belief in the 
                    personality of natural forces, all that close and tender intimacy with the lower 
                    animals, which go to make up that &#x2018;heaven&#x2019;&#x2014;the existence of the world of dull 
                    dead darkness which has supplanted it would not be so inscrutable.&#x201D; But despite the writer&#x02BC;s mournfulness over the defectiveness of the adult mind that 
                    &#x201C;it is &#x005B;only&#x005D; from without, and not from within, that . . . those landscapes of childhood&#x201D; are perceptible, and despite his Dickensian tirade against the modern 
                    &#x201C;stupid system of so&#x2010;called education&#x201D; that deadens us by trampling on &#x201C;the limitless 
                    potentialities of happiness in children,&#x201D; it is clear that the writer is unwilling to relinquish the paradigm of loss of childhood, since it sponsors Wordsworth&#x02BC;s 
                    paradigm of recompense. The reviewer is consoled that the imaginative experience of literature in childhood forms an inalienable part of the psychological and spiritual self, 
                    because this formation is overseen by a Wordsworthian &#x201C;literature of power&#x201D; that insists on the child&#x02BC;s subordination: 
                    &#x201C;&#x005B;I&#x005D;t is impossible to calculate how enormous in moulding the mind is the power of infant literature. 
                    It is not merely that what we read in childhood we never forget, but that it becomes part of our very being.&#x201D; &#x201C;Infant literature&#x201D; means writing <i>for</i> children by adults, 
                    not writing <i>by</i> children. The formation of the self, &#x201C;our very being,&#x201D; depends on a &#x201C;literature of power&#x201D; that guides but silences the child

      </p>
      
      <p>To <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</span> the &#x201C;inscrutable&#x201D; imagination of the child, that &#x201C;nameless and peculiar charm,&#x201D; is likely to produce only &#x201C;precocious smartness,&#x201D; if confronted directly in a child&#x02BC;s writing, 
                    and so he anathematizes the monstrosity of the precocious child writer in his review of <span class="persName-EBB">Barrett Browning&#x02BC;s</span> juvenilia. 
                    He does, however, maintain a circumscribed place of sentiment for the dead child writer of promise, 
                    drawing partly on the <a href="../notes/chatterton_thomas_note.php" target="_blank">Chatterton</a> myth, 
                    but also on the real examples of <a href="../notes/brown_oliver_madox_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Oliver Madox Brown (1855&#x2013;74)</a> and

                    In a bizarre reimagining of <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Intimations Ode,&#x201D; <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> admits how &#x201C;facilities of early printing&#x201D; may &#x201C;be necessary to the full development 
                    of a country&#x02BC;s literary potentialities,&#x201D; by encouraging talent that would otherwise wither; &#x201C;for . . . the violence of the &#x005B;authorial&#x005D; impulse subsides with the subsidence 
                    of the hot enthusiasms of youth,&#x201D; and if the impulse &#x201C;is long kept in check by adverse circumstances, the interests of the world come thicker and thicker, till, at last, that energy which&#x2014;had 
                    the printing difficulty been early overcome&#x2014;would have expressed itself in literature, is exhausted in other channels&#x201D;

                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton&#x02BC;s</span> example of the child writer extinguished by circumstance is the erstwhile poet, <span class="persName-CJW">Charles Jeremiah Wells</span>, 
                    around whom the Pre&#x2010;Raphaelite circle had been constructing a myth of the neglected poet. In <span class="date-1875">1875,</span> <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> published an appreciation of Wells, 
                    in which he presents the writer&#x02BC;s first publication, the <i>Stories after Nature</i> (1822) as neglected juvenilia, &#x201C;written it is said in his earliest youth,&#x201D; 
                    although in fact <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span> published the stories in his early twenties. <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> characterizes the child author of the stories in terms 
                    similar to <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</span> figuration of the child writer as an enigma of nature: &#x201C;The first publication of <span class="persName-CJW">Mr. Wells</span> . . . has much of the charm 
                    and something of the weakness natural to the first flight and the first note of a song&#x2010;bird, whose wings have yet to grow, and whose notes have yet to deepen; 
                    yet in its first flutterings and twitterings there is a nameless grace, a beauty indefinable, which belongs only to the infancy of genius as it belongs only to the infancy of life&#x201D;

      <p>Unlike the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum&#x02BC;s</i></span> reviewer of the Lambs&#x02BC; <span class="title-collected_poems-LAMBSPOETRY"><i>Poetry for Children</i></span>, <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> is willing to imagine the effect of 
                    imaginative writing by a child writer on the &#x201C;a reader of the age at which this book was written,&#x201D; 
                    and he seems to quote himself as just such a youthful reader moved by the impressive effect of these stories. 
                    (Although this review was published in <span class="date-1876">1876</span>, <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> first submitted a version, unsuccessfully, to <i>Fraser&#x02BC;s Magazine</i> in 1861; 
                    and his initial introduction to <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>&#x02BC;s writing probably dated from as early as <span class="date-1857">1857</span>, when he turned twenty and met <span class="persName-DGR">D. G. Rossetti</span>. 
                    Since <span class="date-1849">1849</span>, during the initial formation of the <span class="orgName-PRB">Pre&#x2010;Raphaelite Brotherhood</span>, <span class="persName-DGR">Rossetti</span> had urged the members to regard <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>&#x02BC;s obscure closet drama, <i>Joseph and His Brethren</i> &#x005B;<span class="date-1824">1824</span>&#x005D;, 
                    as a talismanic text, and <span class="persName-DGR">Rossetti</span> persisted in championing <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span> through the <span class="date-1860-1869">1860s,</span> 
                    but dropped the cause in the <span class="date-1870-1879">1870s</span>, when <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span>, with whom <span class="persName-DGR">Rossetti</span> had quarreled, at last succeeded along with <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> and others in getting the play published 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#BUTLERSHIBBOLETH" target="_blank" class="inactive">Butler, &#x201C;Pre&#x2010;Raphaelite Shibboleth&#x201D;</a>, 78, 82&#x2013;84&#x005D;.) 
                    <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span>&#x02BC;s alleged youthful response is scarcely suggestive, however, of an infant connection with a &#x201C;nameless&#x201D; and &#x201C;indefinable&#x201D; beauty that can belong &#x201C;only to the infancy of genius.&#x201D; 
                    While <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> says his youthful self found the <i>Stories from Nature</i> &#x201C;&#x2018;perfect in grace and power, tender and exquisite in choice of language,&#x2019;&#x201D; his early response also emphasized the stories&#x02BC; 
                    &#x201C;&#x2018;noble and masculine delicacy in feeling and purpose.&#x2019;&#x201D; The adult <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne</span> demurs over his early enthusiasm for this boyish but masculine writing, 
                    now demanding that a child reader of Wells&#x02BC;s stories, &#x201C;if there be in him any critical judgment or any promise of such faculty to come,&#x201D; discover that the stories &#x201C;relish of a bastard graft.&#x201D; 
                    Modeled on &#x02BC;s <i>Decameron</i>, 
                    the stories betray excesses of overwrought poetic prose and the influence of <span class="persName-JHLH">Leigh Hunt</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SWINBURNEUNKNOWNPOET" target="_blank" class="inactive">Swinburne, &#x201C;An Unknown Poet&#x201D;</a>, 218).
      </p>
      
      <p>Just so, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> is alarmed by the possibilities opened up by imagining a Wordsworthian child of joy gaining access to a printer before the shades of the prison&#x2010;house can close in upon him. 
                    The only benefit of early publication, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span> decides, is to act as &#x201C;a sort of safety&#x2010;valve or &#x2018;air&#x2010;hole,&#x2019; 
                    from which escapes, to the great good of the producer, the balderdash engendered, like a bad gas, by the active forces of youth.&#x201D; 
                    The child writer, instead of trailing clouds of glory, emits fatuous imagination&#x2014;the advantage of such flights being that, in an age of steam, 
                    early printing at least allows for regulation of the excess energy, as in an engine. 
                    For according to the &#x201C;economy of Nature&#x201D; in an industrial age, when poets can begin publishing at age fourteen, &#x201C;the more genius there is in any youthful brain 
                    the more nonsense&#x201D; there is to be &#x201C;got rid of&#x201D;; and as an additional benefit to the nation, early printing purges the child writer&#x02BC;s impressionable imitations of others. 
                    Just as <span class="persName-ACS">Swinburne&#x02BC;s</span> infant critic recognizes, &#x201C;on taking up the little book &#x005B;by <span class="persName-CJW">Wells</span>&#x005D; again in after years,&#x201D; the undue &#x201C;perceptible influence of <span class="persName-JHLH">Leigh Hunt</span>,&#x201D; so 
                    <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</span> finds belabored in child writing &#x201C;the quintessential amalgam of the literary vices of many predecessors.&#x201D; 
                    The proper &#x201C;education of the poet consists not in learning, but in unlearning,&#x201D; he pronounces; 
                    and early printing at least enables the nation&#x02BC;s youthful writers to unlearn all the sooner, just as the previous generation needed to rid itself of 
                    &#x201C;the concentrated essence of the sentimentality and fustian which infested the literary atmosphere of this country 
                    during the reign of <span class="persName-SJP">Samuel Jackson Pratt</span>&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWBARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <span class="title-collected_poems-BARRETTBROWNINGEARLIERPOEMS1878"><i>The Earlier Poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></span></a>, 765;

                    (<a href="../notes/pratt_samuel_jackson_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-SJP">Pratt</span></a> 
                    was a minor writer in the age of sentiment, whom <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton</span>  
                    cites elsewhere as a standard for the &#x201C;worn&#x2010;out tawdry texture of eighteenth century platitudes&#x201D; 
                    by which to measure the superior but nonetheless &#x201C;gorgeous word&#x2010;spinning so current in our time&#x201D; 
                    &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REVIEWMYERSWORDSWORTH" target="_blank" class="inactive">Unsigned review of <i>English Men of Letters&#x2014;Wordsworth</i> by F. W. H. Myers</a>, 329&#x005D;.)
                
      </p>
      
      <p>In this angry review, then, <span class="persName-TWD">Watts&#x2010;Dunton,</span> belittles the child writer in similar, contradictory terms that the <span class="title-periodical-"><i>Athenaeum</i></span> used to ostracize Shepherd. 
                    If <span class="persName-RHS">Shepherd</span> is insufferably disrespectful of authority in his effete aestheticism, and yet parasitical in his subhuman feeding on the corpus of the author, 
                    the precocious child both threatens to disrupt control by the adult Wordsworthian &#x201C;literature of power&#x201D; that is designed to quell yet enoble his spirit, 
                    and yet is prone slavishly to imitate the most objectionable literary models.
