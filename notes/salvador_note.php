      <p>The courier for the Ruskin family on the <a href="../notes/tour_of_1833.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1833</a>,

      <p>Hiring couriers like the Ruskins&#x02BC; <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> was, according to <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>, 
                    preferable to bringing English servants, who, knowing only their own language, were &#x201C;worse than useless&#x201D; 
                    (putting aside a specialized role for an English servant such as nursing the children, performed for the Ruskins&#x02BC; on these earlier tours by <span class="persName-ASB">Anne Strachan</span>). 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>&#x02BC;s guidebook lists, along with advice about couriers&#x02BC; employment, wages, and treatment, their duties as typically consisting in 
                    &#x201C;preceding the carriage at each stage, to secure relays of post horses&#x201D;; 
                    arranging for &#x201C;reception at inns&#x201D; and securing &#x201C;comfortable rooms, clean and well&#x2010;aired beds, and order&#x005B;ing&#x005D; meals to be prepared&#x201D;; examining the carriage daily for needed repairs, 
                    as &#x201C;it is his fault if any accident occur <i>en route</i>, from neglect of such precautions&#x201D;; superintending &#x201C;the packing and unpacking of the luggage&#x201D; 
                    and insuring its security; 
                    paying &#x201C;innkeepers, postmasters, and postboys&#x201D;; and performing &#x201C;all the services of waiting and attendance, cleaning and brushing clothes,&#x201D; and so forth

      </p> 
      
      <p>As qualifications, <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> emphasizes the courier&#x02BC;s written as well as verbal command of the languages of the places being visited. &#x201C;He never, however, performs the office of a 
                    <i>valet de place</i> while staying in a place, even though he may be well acquainted with it; this he considers out of his province.&#x201D; 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> estimates wages as &#x00A3;8 to &#x00A3;10 monthly&#x2014;even more, if engaged for less than two months; and less, if the traveler remains stationary in a place for an extended period 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-guidebook-MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><i>Handbook for Travellers on the Continent</i></span></a>, xix). 
                    That the Ruskins were generous to their courier is suggested by <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s note that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s account book lists &#x00A3;100 for <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> under &#x201C;Charity &#x0026; Gifts&#x201D; for <span class="date-1835">1835</span>

      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> says that couriers could be engaged on the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span> but also in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> (specifically, No. 7, Old Compton Street, Soho; or No. 11, Panton Square); 
                    and evidently <span class="persName-SALVADOR">Salvador</span> was based in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions in <span class="date-1835-02">February 1835</span> that the courier visited <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> to help plan the route for the 
                    <a href="../notes/tour_of_1835.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1835</a>
