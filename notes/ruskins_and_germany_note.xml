                <p>The Ruskins first visited <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> during the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833">Tour of 1833</ref>. Leading up to that journey, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> purchased unidentified books about the region in <date when="1831">1831</date> and <date when="1832">1832</date>, 
                    a work by <persName corresp="#JCFS">Friedrich Schiller</persName> in <date when="1832">1832</date>, and a German dictionary and a grammar respectively in <date when="1832">1832</date> and <date when="1833">1833</date>. 
                    Following their return, he acquired a &#x201C;P. Rhine&#x201D; in <date when="1834">1834</date>, which was probably

                    by <persName corresp="#EBL">Edward Bulwer&#x2010;Lytton</persName> (<date notBefore="1803" notAfter="1873">1803&#x2013;73</date>), published in that year
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 230 n. 2, 260 n. 2, 286 n. 1).</p>
                <!--<p>Prior to this journey, Ruskin's notions of Germany would have been based primarily on his reading of Grimm</p>-->
                <p>This nationalistic pride in the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> as a &#x201C;German&#x201D; river was a comparatively recent cultural development, as was the sentiment surrounding the ruined medieval 
                    castles towering on the romantic heights above the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Middle Rhine</geogName>. Until well into the eighteenth century, according to <persName corresp="#RRT">Robert R. Taylor</persName> explains, the castles 
                    evoked in Rhinelanders feelings of rivalrous disunity and oppression rather than a unifying national feeling. For each settlement, the river represented 
                    a differently configured boundary and trade artery. Sentiments changed with the development of German Romanticism and taste for the picturesque in the time of <persName corresp="#JWG">Goethe</persName>, 
                    while a more unified German nationalism accompanied the political realignments that followed the defeat of <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> and the dissolution of the Napoleonic <orgName corresp="#GERMANCONFEDERATION">German Confederation</orgName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TAYLORCASTLES"><persName corresp="#RRT">Taylor</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#TAY LORCASTLES"><hi rend="italic">Castles of the Rhine</hi></title></ref>, 24&#x2013;68). In the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCOLOGNECOMP">&#x201C;Cologne&#x201D;</title> section of the 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> announces some of this <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> sentiment, but he also expresses disappointment in the 
                    unpicturesque commercial traffic on the river. It is in the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRANDERNACHTCOMP">&#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D;</title> section (properly spelled <hi rend="italic">Andernach</hi>) that he most positively turns 
                    his unfolding travelogue toward the romantic sentiment of the river, along with its hills (which intrigue him for their formation from volcanic basalt), and its picturesque castle ruins.</p>
