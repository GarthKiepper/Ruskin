                <p>When the Ruskins visited the <ref type="gloss" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_glosses_contextual#FRANCFURTGLOSS">New Cemetery in Frankfurt am Main</ref> 
                    in 1833, John Ruskin perhaps gained his first exposure to the new urban cemeteries that were starting to replace the traditional parish churchyard in the 1820s and 1830s, 
                    although by that time he had also visited Liverpool with his family and therefore may have viewed that city's <placeName corresp="#STJAMESSCEMETERY">St. James's Cemetery</placeName> 
                    opened in <date when="1829">1829</date>. Responding both to hygienic concerns made pressing by rapid urban growth that led to overcrowded city burial places and 
                    to the need for nondenominational alternatives to Anglican parish churchyards, the new cemeteries were operated by joint stock companies.</p>
                
                <p>Architecturally, these cemeteries presented a significant focus for neoclassicism until that taste was displaced by Gothic Revival influences at mid-century. Entered via a massive gatehouse 
                    often modeled on the Greek Doric propylaeum, the grounds were conceived as a classical Elysium, inspired by the Arcadian landscape tradition in painting and estate gardening. 
                    Another classical model was the "city of the dead" or necropolis, drawn from Etruscan tomb complexes and (although quite different from the Etruscan model in origin and conception) Roman catacombs. 
                    At the same time, since the new cemetery designs arose well into the nineteenth century, the non-classical taste for the picturesque guided the layout 
                    of walks, drives, and botanical interests. Thus, the English gardening tradition combined with classical monuments, even in Continental new cemeteries. 
                    The hugely influential design combining these elements was the Cimeti&#x00E8;re du P&#x00E8;re-Lachaise in Paris, established in 1804, 
                    and created by Alexandre-Th&#x00E9;odore Brongniart (1739-1813) 
                    under the patronage of Napoleon Bonaparte. In Britain, cemetery architecture eventually came under the influence of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="loudon_j_c_note.php">John Claudius Loudon</ref> (1783-1843), 
                    who modified the combined Arcadian and picturesque tastes that had governed the garden cemetery, by enforcing a characteristically comprehensive plan 
                    that was hygienically practical for disposal of the dead yet also morally instructive for the living observer. Loudon's treatise, 
                    On the Laying Out, Planting, and Managing of Cemeteries; and on the Improvement of Churchyards was published in the year of his death
