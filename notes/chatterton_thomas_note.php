      <p>Poet and forger. <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> was born in <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, where he entered a charity school at age eight and soon began to exhibit precocious learning. 
                    By age twelve, he launched his elaborate forgery scheme of composing works he attributed to a  priest, <span class="persName-TRPriest">Thomas Rowley</span>, 
                    and producing material evidence using scraps of old parchment. Ambitious to make a literary career, at age seventeen he threatened suicide in order 
                    to dissolve his apprenticeship as a legal scrivener to a <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span> attorney. Less successfully, he attempted to use his <span class="persName-TRPriest">Rowley</span> forgeries to capture the patronage of the antiquarian, 
                    <span class="persName-HW">Horace Walpole</span> (<span class="date-1717-1797">1717&#x2010;97</span>), but <span class="persName-HW">Walpole</span> recognized the imposture. <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> set out for <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, where he began to rise rapidly in reputation as a free&#x2010;lance writer, 
                    but his career was abruptly cut off by a poisoning, which <span class="persName-NG">Nick Groom</span> attributes to misjudged mixing of recreational opium with arsenic treatment for venereal disease 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CHATTERTONDNB" target="_blank" class="inactive">Groom, <span class="title-essay-CHATTERTONDNB">&#x201C;Chatterton, Thomas (1752&#x2010;70)&#x201D;</span></a>).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>As a Romantic mythology developed around the figure of <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>, competing ideas of what he represented were available in the decades following his death, 
                    as <span class="persName-DF">David Fairer</span> describes. In one idea, he was not a boy but a &#x201C;manly&#x201D; youth, and a fearless defender of political liberty. 
                    Alternatively, some emphasized his role as victim, spurned by the haughty <span class="persName-HW">Walpole</span> and abandoned by society to die in a garret, 
                    a rare and neglected poetic spirit. In the idea of <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>&#x02BC;s victimization, the satiric mode shades into the &#x201C;lyric&#x2010;descriptive,&#x201D;
                    as <span class="persName-DF">Fairer</span> puts it, with fragile flower imagery predominating, and with a tendency to present <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>&#x02BC;s poetic voice as disembodied. 
                    Finally, a dramatic mode imagined the horrors and suffering of what was commonly believed to have been the youth&#x02BC;s suicidal death
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FAIRERCHATTERTON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Fairer, <span class="title-FAIRERCHATTERTON">&#x201C;Chatterton&#x02BC;s Poetic Afterlife, 1770&#x2013;1794&#x201D;</span></a>, 232&#x2010;40).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Of these modes, it was the lyric&#x2010;descriptive, and the idea of <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> as victim, which <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> suggests when invoking the myth of the spurned poet 
                    in an  letter to <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank">James Hogg (ca.1770&#x2013;1835)</a>. 
                    While not naming <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> draws on the mythology surrounding the boy poet when broaching the question of whether <span class="persName-JJR">John Ruskin</span> 
                    was truly a youthful genius and poet in the making; and if so, what he and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> should do to protect and nurture the boy&#x02BC;s talent: 
                    &#x201C;we dread the sacrifice of our offspring by making him a victim to the pangs of despised verse, a sacrifice to a thankless world, 
                    who read, admire, and trample on the greatest and the best&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Garden, ed., <span class="title-book-GARDENMEMORIALS"><i>Memorials of James Hogg</i></span></a>, 275).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>The extent to which <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> was present in the Ruskins&#x02BC; imagination is difficult to judge. 
                    While the &#x201C;marvellous boy,&#x201D; in <span class="persName-WW">Wordsworth</span>&#x02BC;s phrase, had become inextricably bound to the Romantics&#x02BC; idea of literary precocity, 
                    suicide was a particularly unwelcome topic in the Ruskin family, 
                    owing to the death of <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s father, 
                    <span class="persName-JTR">John Thomas Ruskin</span> (<span class="date-1761-1817">1761&#x2010;1817</span>), by his own hand, 
                    a suicide that occurred when <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> was on the premises.  
                    It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> originally composed his elegiac poem, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/twas_night_i_stood_by_tweeds_fair_stream_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;&#x02BC;Twas night. I stood by Tweed&#x02BC;s fair stream&#x201D;</a>, 
                    in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> in reference to <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>, but altered details to refer instead 
                    to <a href="../notes/scott_walter_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (<span class="date-1771-1832">1771&#x2013;1832</span>)</a>, 
                    when the Scottish poet died a short time later. 
                    In the draft of the poem, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> named the <span class="placeName-AVONRIVER">Avon River</span>, which flows through <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, 
                    but then he changed the river&#x02BC;s name to the <span class="placeName-TWEEDRIVER">Tweed</span>.
                
      </p> 
      
      <p>Years later, in his <span class="title-essay-RUSKINACADEMYNOTES"><i>Academy Notes</i></span> for , 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admired the painting of the poet&#x02BC;s suicide by <span class="persName-HWPAINTER">Henry Wallis</span> (<span class="date-1830-1916">1830&#x02BC;1916</span>), but wrote about it in very general terms, exhorting viewers to &#x201C;examine it well inch by inch,&#x201D; 
                    for the sake of its &#x201C;entire placing before your eyes of an actual fact&#x2014;and that a solemn one&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 14: 60). 
                    Just as this picture would soon become associated with the scandal that developed between its painter and the wife of its model, 
                    <span class="persName-GM">George Meredith</span> (<span class="date-1828-1909">1828&#x2010;1909</span>), another aspect of the <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> myth perhaps became disturbingly pertinent to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x2014;the poet&#x02BC;s androgynous and permanent boyishness, 
                    asexual and unwed (contrary to the historical <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span>&#x02BC;s promiscuity). As <span class="persName-JCCRITIC">Julie Crane</span> concludes, 
                    &#x201C;for the Victorians, whose plots used marriage as a device, &#x005B;yet&#x005D; for whom in their lives . . . &#x005B;marriage&#x005D; was often a disaster, . . . 
                    the pre&#x2010;Romantic <span class="persName-TCPOET">Chatterton</span> became a Romantic figure of disturbing possibilities: both endlessly fecund and self&#x2010;dividing into different ways and suggestivenss; 
                    and a silenced being, unwed, austere&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CRANECHATTERTON" target="_blank" class="inactive">Crane, <span class="title-essay-CRANECHATTERTON">&#x201C;&#x2018;Wandering between Two Worlds&#x2019; The Victorian Afterlife of Thomas Chatterton&#x201D;</span></a>, 37).
