                    <p>In March 1847, when John James Ruskin wrote to his friend, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="harrison_w_h_note.php"><persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1878">1792&#x2013;1878</date>)</ref>, 
                        to affirm his intention to have a collection of his son's poems printed, 
                        he referred to having "had for a very long time a Volume of yours containing some light pieces of my son." Before the Poems (1850) was realized, in other words, the Ruskin circle 
                        produced and made use of compilations of Ruskin's poems (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><placeName corresp="#LEEDS">Leeds</placeName>, <date when="1847-03-08">8 March 1847</date></title>, in

                        The volume mentioned in this letter probably refers to a present from Harrison to John James for the holiday season of <date when="1844-12-25">Christmas 1844</date> and <date when="1845-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s 1845</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>On <date when="1845-01-04">4 January 1845</date>, while spending a disagreeably unseasonal holiday at the seaside with his family in <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> thanked <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> for the &#x201C;trouble you have taken to get me a Set of

                        referring to his son by the pen name used for most of his contributions to annuals 
                        (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1845-01-04">letter</title>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMSL5"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>, 1838&#x2013;1853</ref>). 
                        The current location of this volume, if extant, is unknown, so its contents cannot now be determined. If limited, as John James indicates, to contributions to 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title></ref>, 
                        the choice was logical as a gift from the former editor (<date notBefore="1836" notAfter="1841">1836&#x2013;41</date>) of the annual, 
                        who grew particularly close to the Ruskin family during that tenure. It is perhaps no coincidence that the holiday season of Harrison's gift marked the end of Ruskin's regular appearances 
                        in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, in the volumes for 1835 through 1844. Poems by J.R. apppeared
                        instead in two annuals edited by Lady Blessington for Longmans, as discussed below.</p>
                    
                    <p>Possibly the &#x201C;set&#x201D; described by John James was the collection of &#x02BC;proofs of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s contributions 
                        to <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>&#x02BD; that, according to the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName> &#x02BC;bound up&#x02BD; for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> to carry &#x02BC;on his tours&#x02BD;

                        it would also have been welcome to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> for ease of reference. As he commented later in the year to <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, 
                        John James was often frustrated by &#x201C;the Scatterment&#x201D; of his son&#x02BC;s poems published in annuals over several years; it was &#x201C;the Looking for the needle in the Bundle of Hay

                        is the manuscript, <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="edmond_ms_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;J. Ruskin &#x007C; Poems&#x201D; (n.d.), or &#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        a bound volume of holograph transcriptions of poems published in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>. 
                        As a holograph manuscript, it does not answer to the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>&#x02BC;s description of <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        bound proofs. It also lacks transcriptions of poems that, in addition to those appearing in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, 
                        were published in <date when="1839">1839</date> in the <title type="periodical" corresp="#LONDONMONTHLYMISC"><hi rend="italic">London Monthly Miscellany</hi></title> 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:5). Since this magazine also was edited by 
                        <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, the omission seems notable if the volume is imagined as originating with him.</p>
                    
                    <p>The hand responsible for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title> has not been identified; however, the physical item makes a good fit 
                        with circumstances mentioned by John James in his <title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1847-03-08"><date when="1847-03-08">8 March 1847</date> letter</title> to Harrison announcing 
                        his intention to have Ruskin's poems printed. After referring to Harrison's "volume", John James goes on: "I have delayed having them [John's "verses"] penned because I want to get the best 
                        of all he has ever penned selected &#x0026; printed in good Type." The <hi rend="italic">penning</hi> clearly refers to a copyist's work at the behest of John James, which may have been 
                        related to publication plans. Harold Shapiro, in his edition of Ruskin's letters from Italy in 1845, speculates that John James used such procedures with the intention of publishing 
                        John's letters as an epistolary travel narrative: "He carefully preserved them, of course, and put them in order. More than that, the originals are full of his markings. He numbered them, 
                        supplied missing dates and places in the headings, made notations on them for a copyist, underlined the passages to be copied, cancelled details to be omitted, and even inserted a word 
                        here and there" (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKININITALY"><persName corresp="#HIS">Shapiro</persName>, introduction to <title type="book" corresp="RUSKININITALY"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin in Italy</hi></title></ref>, xx). 
                        While no such editorial markings by John James are evident in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#EDMONDMS">&#x201C;Edmond manuscript&#x201D;</title>, its very exacting transcriptions 
                        might represent a stage in the evolving plans toward a printed volume; and while obviously not a "delayed" transcription, it would have been a faulty effort for John James's requirements in 1847. 
                        As explained in the <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="edmond_ms_apparatus.php#DESCRIPTION">description</ref> of the manuscript, the transcriptions are not "selected"--starting, 
                        as they do, with "Saltzburg", Ruskin's first poem published in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></title>, 
                        which was not ultimately chosen for inclusion in the Poems (1850)--and the sequence founders owing to a mistake in transcription of the poems for <date when="1842">1842</date>. Even if not related directly 
                        to the project of printing the Poems in 1850, however, the manuscript attests at the very least to the interest before 1850 in collecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poems scattered throughout published annuals.</p>

                    as she had done with three poems by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in the previous year. &#x201C;You know we centred all in <title ref="annual" corresp="#FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING">F. O.</title>&#x201D;, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> reminded <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, referring to the long run of poems by <persName type="pen_name" corresp="#JR">J.R.</persName> 
                    published in the <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> annual. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> pointed out that it would be &#x201C;no joke&#x201D; 
                    having to present each of many friends with two annuals for the year&#x2014;and those two nothing less than the grand and expensive publications superintended for

                    as compared with the familiar and less imposing annual produced by the Ruskins&#x02BC; friends at <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>

                    <p>A more worrying prospect to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> than the expense of holiday gifts, however, and a more emotional cause for collecting the poems for publication 
                        in <date when="1850">1850</date>, was that the poems were becoming less important to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself. Already, the poems collected in <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        <date when="1845">1845</date> gift compilation led to some affectation of indifference, &#x201C;some in this House [having] had no recollection of having before seen&#x201D; certain poems, 
                    although considerably connected with the Author&#x201D;
                    (<title type="letter" corresp="#jjr_to_whh_1845-01-31"><placeName corresp="#DENMARKHL">Denmark Hill</placeName>, <date when="1845-01-31">31 January 1845</date></title>, in

                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> grew more outspoken about losing interest in verse composition after he departed for <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> in <date when="1845-04">April 1845</date>, 
                    his first Continental tour without his parents&#x02BC; direct supervision, in order to study the Old Masters in preparation for completing the <title type="book" corresp="#JRMODERNPAINTERS2">second volume of <hi rend="itqlic">Modern Painters</hi></title>. 
                    While continuing to oblige his father by sending home new poems, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> paraded his indifference: &#x201C;Of course do all that you like with poems. 
                        <persName corresp="#MGBLESSINGTON">Lady B[lessington]</persName> just as good as any one. I have neither pride nor pleasure in them&#x201D;. Writing less flippantly on his father&#x02BC; birthday, 
                        he explained that his poetical impulse was being displaced by a critical temper: 
                    &#x201C;I almost always see two sides of a thing at once, now&#x2014;in matters poetical&#x2014;&#x0026; I never get strongly excited without perceiving drawbacks &#x0026; imperfections 
                    which somehow one lost sight of when one was younger&#x201D;
