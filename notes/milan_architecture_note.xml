                <head type="title">Napoleonic Monuments in Milan</head>
                <p>When the Ruskins visited <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> in <date when="1833">1833</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cousin, 
                    <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, took note especially of Napoleonic monuments in the city. In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s extant writing about the city 
                    for the <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>&#x2014;the poem 
                    <ref type="witness" target="milan_cathedral_poem_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRMILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title></ref>&#x2014;his 
                    imagination is captured by the vertical thrust of the Gothic architecture complemented by the mountain heights beyond the city. In contrast, a planned but apparently unexecuted section for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRCORSOMILANCOMP">&#x201C;The Corso of Milan&#x201D;</title>, presumably would have reflected the horizontal expanse of neoclassical and Napoleonic&#x2010;era monuments in the city 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>; 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for the Continuation of the Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>).</p>
                <p>During the Enlightenment, under the administration of the <orgName corresp="#HAPSBURG">Hapsburgs</orgName>, urban planning in neoclassical style for <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> 
                    was overseen by the architect <persName corresp="#GPIERMARINI">Giuseppe Piermarini</persName> (<date notBefore="1734" notAfter="1808">1734&#x2013;1808</date>). The Ruskins 
                    visited his most famous building, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#TEATROALLASCALA">Teatro alla Scala</placeName> (<date notBefore="1776" notAfter="1778">1776&#x2013;78</date>), 
                    although they were unable to attend a performance, and they would have encountered other structures associated with <persName corresp="#GPIERMARINI">Piermarini</persName>&#x02BC;s neoclassical renovations 
                    throughout the city. For example, the <hi rend="italic">corso</hi> that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> planned to write about and that <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> mentions in her diary was most likely 
                    the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Corso di Porta Orientale</placeName> (also known as the <placeName corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Porta Venezia</placeName>), 
                    which underwent modernization between <date when="1827">1827</date> and the year of the Ruskins&#x02BC; visit, <date when="1833">1833</date>. 
                    Designed by <persName corresp="#RVANTINI">Rodolfo Vantini</persName> (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1856">1792&#x2013;1856</date>), its gateway is marked by a pair of cubical structures that, 
                    like the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANDEBURGGATE">Brandeburg Gate</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#BERLIN">Berlin</placeName>, 
                    evoke the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PROPYLAEAATHENS">Propylaea of the Acropolis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#ATHENS">Athens</placeName>. In the late eighteenth 
                    and early nineteenth centuries, such imposing neoclassical gates were meant to herald the entrance to the city conceived as &#x201C;work of art&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ETLINSYMBOLICSPACE"><persName corresp="#RAETLIN">Etlin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="ETLINSYMBOLICSPACE"><hi rend="italic">Symbolic Space</hi></title></ref>, 2&#x2013;4; 
                    and see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#OLSENCITY"><persName corresp="#DJOLSEN">Olsen</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="OLSENCITY"><hi rend="italic">The City as a Work of Art</hi></title></ref>).</p>
                <p>By the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, however, the Enlightenment <orgName corresp="#HAPSBURG">Hapsburg</orgName> project in <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> 
                    had been overlain by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for the city, which appropriated the neoclassical design 
                    to promote republican and imperial ideals. This symbolism was often expressed using a columnar, Doric vocabulary associated with <placeName corresp="#PAESTUM">Paestum</placeName>. 
                    The Ruskins appear to have sought out these Napoleonic monuments, including a vast &#x201C;amphitheatre&#x201D;, referring apparently to the <placeName corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</placeName> (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1806">1801-6</date>), 
                    planned by <persName corresp="#GAANTOLINI">Giovanni Antonio Antolini</persName> (<date notBefore="1756" notAfter="1841">1756-1841</date>) as a spectacular entrance to the city from the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Strada del Sempione</geogName>, 
                    connecting to the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</geogName>, which <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s engineers had modernized as an accessible carriage road. The <placeName type="building" corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</placeName> was completed in altered form 
                    by Luigi Canonica (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1844">1762-1844</date>). At its entrance on the city side, the Ruskins also viewed the arch commemorating <persName corresp="#NBE">Napeoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s victory at <placeName corresp="#MARENGO">Marengo</placeName> (now known as the <placeName type="building" corresp="#ARCODELLAPACE">Arco della Pace</placeName>), 
                    designed by Luigi Cagnola (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1833">1762-1833</date>), begun in <date notBefore="1807">1807</date> and still incomplete when the Ruskins visited. On their last day in <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, they viewed <persName corresp="#MLCAGNOLA">Cagnola</persName>&#x02BC;s city gate built 
                    &#x201C;in memory of [<persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s] victory at <placeName corresp="#MARENGO">Marengo</placeName>&#x201D;, today known as the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTATICINESE">Porta Ticinese</placeName> (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1814">1801-14</date>) (Kirk 77-83, 91-98).</p>
                <p> what she calls the <name type="building" corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Amphitheatre</name>, designed to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators 
                    (probably referring to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</placeName>, <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1806">1801&#x2013;6</date>, 
                    planned by <persName corresp="#GAANTOLINI">Giovanni Antonio Antolini</persName> [<date notBefore="1756" notAfter="1841">1756&#x2013;1841</date>] as a spectacular entrance to the city from the <placeName type="building" corresp="#STRADADELSEMPIONE">Strada del Sempione</placeName>); 
                    and the arch commemorating this road, which led to the mountain pass that <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s engineers had forged through the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</title></ref>, 46). 
                    See Ruskin's planned section of the "Account" on the Corso of Milan and associated glosses. These Napoleonic projects were designed to impress an imperial stamp 
                    on the principal cities of the Italian kingdom. The <name type="building" corresp="#AMPHITHEATREMILAN">Amphitheatre</name> was built to stage military parades and spectacles; and the arch proclaimed a ceremonial finish for the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName> road, 
                    which was extended into <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> under the name of the Strada Napoleone (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GREGORYNAPOLEONSITALY"><persName corresp="#DGREGORY">Gregory</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#GREGORYNAPOLEONSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Napoleon&#x02BC;s Italy</hi></title></ref>, 75&#x2013;76). 
                    At the time of the Ruskins&#x02BC; visit, the latter monument not only remained under construction, like the <name type="building" corresp="#DUOMOMILAN">Duomo</name>, but was also in process of redefinition. As explained in <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKNORTHERNITALY1847"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s guide to northern Italy</title> 
                    (<date when="1847">1847</date>), the triumphal arch was begun in <date notBefore="1806" notAfter="1807">1806&#x2013;7</date> as the &#x201C;Arch of the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon</geogName> . . . in commemoration of the <date when="1806-10-14">battle of Jena</date>&#x201D;&#x2014;<persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    victory over the Prussian army, in the war against the Fourth Coalition of allies&#x2014;and the monument was meant to be decorated &#x201C;with bas&#x2010;reliefs representing the events of <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleon&#x02BC;s wars</date>&#x201D;; 
                    however, when the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> fell and <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> returned to control by <placeName corresp="#AUSTRIA">Austria</placeName>, the name of the monument &#x201C;was changed to the Arch of Peace, . . . and the sculptures underwent a transformation 
                    to make them represent the events which preceded the general peace&#x201D; (completed after the Ruskins&#x02BC; visit, in <date when="1838">1838</date>, for the <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName> coronation of the Austrian emperor, <persName corresp="#FERDINAND">Ferdinand I</persName>).
