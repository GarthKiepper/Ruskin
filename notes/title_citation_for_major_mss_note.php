      <div class="title">The System of Title Citation for Manuscripts</div>
      
      <p>The Apparatus Page for each manuscript begins with a section, &#x201C;Title,&#x201D; which discusses the name of that manuscript&#x2014;a more or less complicated topic, 
                    depending on how many naming systems have been applied to the manuscript in question. The most familiar system historically, 
                    and therefore the one adopted most pervasively in <i>ERM</i> for hyperlinking purposes, 
                    derives from <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s bibliographical practice in 
                    <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a>. 
                    Another system derives from <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own practices of naming the manuscripts, whether in youth or old age. 
                    Because neither of these practices was consistent and comprehensive, the traditions of naming the manuscripts require to be supplemented.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>In youth, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was working with his manuscripts, his names for them tended to be either generic&#x2014;as 
                    in the term <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank"><i>red book</i></a>, 
                    which applied to a class of small, reddish-brown bound notebooks used for the earliest juvenilia&#x2014;or derived 
                    from a work contained in the manuscript. For example, in <span class="date-1829-03">March 1829</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote to his father: 
                    &#x201C;I am trying to get that red book of mine which has the Monastery in it finished, by the time you come home,&#x201D; 
                    referring both to <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a> and to 
                    a work, <a href="../apparatuses/the_monastery_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</a>, included in the notebook. 
                    The work, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> versification of the novel by <span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span>, is not the most prominent piece contained in the Red Book, 
                    but it happened to be uppermost in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> mind at the time.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>In many of the initially blank, bound notebooks and ledgers that Ruskin typically used to draft or fair copy his work&#x2014;he 
                    also used loose sheets of paper, or pamphlets folded and sewn by hand 
                    (see <a href="../notes/overview_of_mss_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Overview of Manuscripts</a>)&#x2014;he dedicated the notebook initially to a major work, 
                    for which he devised a decorated title page. 
                    For example, <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a>, and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msiiia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IIIA</a>, begin with volumes 1, 2, and 3, 
                    respectively, of <span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy.&#x201D;</span> Presumably, in these cases, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> referred to the manuscript by the title of its major work, using that title interchangeably 
                    for the text of the work and for the physical manuscript witnessing its fair copy. 
                    Thus, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> announces in a <span class="date-1832-01-14">14 January 1832</span> letter that <span class="title-poem-ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</span> is at last finished, quite copied in, fairly dismissed,&#x201D; 
                    and that he has &#x201C;put such a finis&#x201D; with &#x201C;innumerable flourishes with which it is decorated and the paper loaded 
                    you would think there never was to be a beginning of that end,&#x201D; he clearly means that he has &#x201C;copied in&#x201D; the work, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</span></a>, into the bound notebook that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> would later designate as 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msvii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VII</a>, and &#x201C;decorated&#x201D; and &#x201C;loaded&#x201D; the &#x201C;paper&#x201D; of the physical object in order to celebrate 
                    completion of the text of the poem. The title &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; applied equally to the text of the poem and to its fair-copy manuscript.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Such coterminous titles could not have been stable, however. We do not know what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> called the notebook containing the fair copy of 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</span></a> when, over time, he subjected this notebook, 
                    like so many of his manuscripts, to additional uses. In this case, he followed 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</span></a> in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msvii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS VII</a> with a fair copy of a new, but never-completed epic poem, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/athens_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-ATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</span></a>. Later, still more works were fair-copied into this ledger. 
                    Titles of manuscripts could shift with their uses. The handmade pamphlet now known as 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS II</a> shows &#x201C;Vol 1&#x201D; scrawled on the top right corner of its first recto. 
                    The designation appears as an afterthought, inserted into a space next to the title of the first poem 
                    of this little anthology. What the name of the manuscript means is obscure: other, complementary &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; may have existed, 
                    but it is just as likely that the pamphlet only temporarily occupied the position of first in a putative series that remained only an idea.
                
      </p> 
      
      <p>Titles could also be kept deliberately open-ended. On the first blank recto of the notebook now known as <a href="../apparatuses/msv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS V</a>, 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote the heading, &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry,&#x201D; and numbered this recto as page 1. As a title for the anthology of poems contained in the notebook, 
                    &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry&#x201D; became intriguingly coterminous for both the text of the anthology and for the physical notebook containing the text, 
                    when Ruskin&#x02BC;s father inserted below <span class="persName-JR">John&#x02BC;s</span> title the attribution, 
                    &#x201C;By <span class="persName-JR">J. Ruskin</span> from 10 years to 11 to 12 to &#x005B;. . .&#x005D; of age&#x201D;&#x2014;the ellipsis representing a gap that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> left to be filled in, 
                    as the anthology progressed. Thus, the collaborative title&#x2014;along with the text of the anthology&#x2014;remained open-ended, 
                    as the text advanced toward the physical limits 
                    of the notebook that defined the scope of the anthology. <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> never completed his portion of the title 
                    because <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> never filled the notebook&#x2014;the unpunctuated 
                    final line, &#x201C;Away and away,&#x201D; of the last poem added to the anthology trailing off into the blankness of remaining pages.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Even when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> usage of a title is documented consistently over time, 
                    the evidence may be unclear to what the title refers. 
                    In letters of <span class="date-1832">1832</span> and <span class="date-1835">1835</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentioned his &#x201C;mineralogical dictionary,&#x201D; 
                    and both the title and (roughly) the dates of composition held good decades later, 
                    when in <span class="date-1864">1864</span> <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> referred to having &#x201C;written a <span class="title-reference-MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY"><i>Mineralogical Dictionary</i></span>,&#x201D; 
                    for which he &#x201C;invented a shorthand symbolism for crystalline forms, 
                    before &#x005B;he&#x005D; was fourteen.&#x201D; Again, in <span class="date-1875">1875</span>, in <i>Deucalion</i>, he wanted readers to know that he 
                    &#x201C;began when . . . only twelve years old, a <span class="title-reference-MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY"><i>Mineralogical Dictionary</i></span>, 
                    written in a shorthand composed of crystallographic signs now entirely unintelligble to me.&#x201D; 
                    Finally, in <span class="date-1885">1885</span> in <span class="title-autobiography-PRAETERITA"><i>Praeterita</i></span>, he remembered that his &#x201C;fifteenth birthday gift&#x201D; of <i>Voyages dans les Alpes</i>, 
                    by <span class="persName-HBS">Horace B&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;dict de Saussure</span>, assisted him in &#x201C;carrying on &#x005B;his&#x005D; mineralogical dictionary&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd ed., <span class="title-collected_letters-RFL"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></span></a>, 263, 311; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 26: 553, 97; 35: 121). 
                    In the <span class="date-1930-1939">1930s</span>, when <span class="persName-CG">Charles Goodspeed</span> purchased <span class="title-manuscript-EARLYGEOLOGY">&#x201C;Early Geology&#x201D;</span> included in lot 27 of 
                    <a href="../notes/provenance_sothebys_1931_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sotheby&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1931</a>, 
                    he did not hesitate to advertise this manuscript for sale as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> &#x201C;Mineralogical Dictionary&#x201D; 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#GOODSPEEDCAT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Goodspeed&#x02BC;s Book Shop, <i>A Catalogue of Paintings, Drawings and Manuscripts by John Ruskin</i></a>, 20; 
                    and see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SOTHEBYCAT1931" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <i>Catalogue of the Final Portion of the Manuscripts &#x0026; Library of John Ruskin</i></a>, 6). 
                    But while this manuscript does include portions written in a boyhood &#x201C;shorthand symbolism,&#x201D; 
                    it shows no title; and this manuscript, or compilation of manuscripts, which was bound in red buckram at some point during preparation of the 
                    <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> and labeled 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/ms_early_geology_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-EARLYGEOLOGY">Early Geology</span></a> on the spine 
                    may or may not include what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> meant in <span class="date-1832">1832</span> and/or <span class="date-1835">1835</span> by his &#x201C;mineralogical dictionary&#x201D;&#x2014;or even in <span class="date-1864">1864</span>, <span class="date-1875">1875</span>, or <span class="date-1885">1885</span>. 
                    (Another example of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> exhibiting different ideas at different times about his early manuscripts is his docketing of some of the 
                    <a href="../notes/red_book_note" target="_blank" class="inactive">Red Books</a> in <span class="date-1870">1870</span>, using a numbering scheme guided by some purpose that can now only guessed at.)
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Perhaps owing to an awareness of these ambiguities, or perhaps just for the sake of simplicity, 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> was led in <span class="date-1891">1891</span> to found a numerical system of identifying the early manuscripts. 
                    In the &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems,&#x201D; appended to his edition of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> poetry, 
                    the <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (1891)</a>, 
                    <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> compiled the first systematic descriptive bibliography of selected early manuscripts, 
                    and he identified these manuscripts according to a sequence of Roman numerals 
                    (<i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1: 261&#x2013;67; 
                    <i>Poems</i> &#x005B;8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1: 262&#x2013;68). 
                    The primary purpose of this descriptive bibliography was to explain and justify a chronological order of the manuscripts, 
                    supplying a &#x201C;justification of the hypothetical dates assigned to some of the poems&#x201D; 
                    (<i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1: 261; 
                    <i>Poems</i> &#x005B;8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;, 1: 262&#x2013;63). 
                    The Roman numerals reenforced this idea of a proven chronology. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> scheme was elaborated by subsequent editors. 
                    A decade after the <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (1891)</a>, 
                    the editors of the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a>, 
                    <a href="../notes/cook_e_t_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">E. T. Cook (1857&#x2013;1919)</a> and 
                    <a href="../notes/wedderburn_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Alexander Wedderburn (1854&#x2013;1931)</a>,  
                    carried forward with Collingwood&#x02BC;s nomenclature by reprinting and expanding his &#x201C;Note&#x201D; as an appendix to 
                    the <span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span>, volume 2 (<span class="date-1902">1902</span>) of the <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span>.
                    In <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> <span class="title-essay-WEDDERBURNNOTES">&#x201C;Notes on the Original MSS. of the Poems  &#x005B;Revised and Completed from the Edition of <span class="date-1891">1891</span>&#x005D;,&#x201D;</span> 
                    the editors accounted for manuscripts that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had omitted by inserting new descriptions 
                    and designating them with a Roman numeral plus an English alphabet letter. 
                    In this way, the editors attempted to maintain <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> chronological order, inserting the new item into its appropriate place in the numerical order 
                    Thus, for example, they inserted <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msib_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IB</a> between the manuscripts that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had numbered 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a> and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS II</a>, because the earliest work contained in 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msia_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a> and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msib_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IB</a> as a whole appeared to fall chronologically into that position.
                
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> aim of representing a chronological order of manuscripts 
                    could never have achieved more than an approximation of the manuscripts&#x02BC; sequence, since several of the bound manuscripts overlap one another 
                    in the chronological range of their contents. His sequence is also erroneous in parts owing to misdating of some manuscripts. 
                    Most problematically, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> decided from the start to omit from the &#x201C;Note&#x201D; those manuscripts containing exclusively prose, 
                    as these seemed to him irrelevant to the project of editing the <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS4D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (1891)</a>. 
                    Presumably, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> intended ultimately to supply a corresponding nomenclature for manuscripts to be included in a complementary edition of the
                    early prose, but this project never came to pass  
                    (see <a href="../notes/history_of_bibliography_and_editing_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">History of Bibliography and Editing of the Early Manuscripts</a>). 
                    As a result, arbitrary and misleading limitations were built into the scope of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> bibliography, 
                    confusions that <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> perpetuated by confining their revision of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> &#x201C;Note&#x201D; to manuscripts containing poetry, 
                    and relegating prose manuscripts to the <i>Bibliography</i>, volume 39 (<span class="date-1912">1912</span>) of the <i>Works</i>.
                
      </p> 
      
      <p>In <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> bibliography, the early prose manuscripts known to them appear in division III, <span class="title-bibliography-CATALOGUEOFRUSKINMSS">&#x201C;Catalogue of Ruskin MSS.,&#x201D;</span> 
                    section B, &#x201C;Diaries and Note-Books&#x201D; (as opposed to manuscripts of published works, in section A), subsection <i>b</i>, &#x201C;Note-Books, Etc.&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 39: 205&#x2013;6).
                    The prose manuscripts are assigned discursive titles, rather than Roman numerals, such as &#x201C;Sermon Book (1827),&#x201D; &#x201C;Mineralogical Dict. (1831),&#x201D; and 
                    &#x201C;Juvenilia.&#x201D; The latter title subsumes three early notebooks, collected together and separated without explanation from other prose manuscripts of the 
                    <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span> listed under their own titles; presumably, the editors associated them, because all three are 
                    <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Books</a>. These three notebooks are given brief descriptions rather than titles 
                    (in <i>ERM</i>, the three notebooks correspond, respectively, to 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msja_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS Juvenilia A</a>, 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msjb_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS Juvenilia B</a>, and 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msjc_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS Juvenilia C</a>).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Elsewhere in <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> bibliography, the editors list &#x201C;Minor Writings&#x201D; that are quoted thoughout the <i>Works</i>, 
                    including brief &#x201C;extracts&#x201D; from &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D; (some prose, some poetry) 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-JRWORKSLE"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 39: 92).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>One solution to this complexity would be to scrap <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> nomenclature, and start anew with a corrected and comprehensive system, 
                    but this drastic move would cause unnecessary confusion. 
                    More than a century&#x02BC;s accumulation of scholarship has relied on the nomenclature in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> &#x201C;Note&#x201D; as expanded in the Library Edition. 
                    Moreover, the &#x201C;Note,&#x201D; however faulty, retains considerable historical interest, as <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> compiled it when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was still alive; 
                    and while the ill and elderly <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> is unlikely to contributed in any extensive way to this descriptive bibliography, 
                    one cannot discount the possibility that the &#x201C;Note&#x201D; conveys some of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</span> own
                    ideas about the preservation and classification of these manuscripts. 
                    Even if <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> played no part at all in <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> editing of the 
                    <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-anthology-POEMS8D1891"><i>Poems</i></span> (1891)</a>, 
                    the involvement of the fin de siècle Brantwood circle in the project is just as significant.
                
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="persName-HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> solution was to compile her own version of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> &#x201C;Note,&#x201D; in competition with <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> version. 
                    In her typescript, &#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood,&#x201D; a descriptive bibliography that she attached as &#x201C;Appendix VII&#x201D; 
                    to her unfinished biography of Ruskin, &#x201C;Dark Star&#x201D; 
                    (1930&#x2013;48, in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VILJOENPAPERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Helen Gill Viljoen Papers&#x201D;</a>), 
                    <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> continued <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> practice in the Library Edition of fitting additional manuscripts into <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> 
                    Roman-numeral scheme of chronological sequence; for example, 
                    the &#x201C;Sermon Book&#x201D; that <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> list in their bibliography 
                    (III.B.<i>b</i> &#x005B;<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#LE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 39: 206&#x005D;) 
                    becomes MSS No. II.A, B, C, D, and E, containing the 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/sermons_on_the_pentateuch_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sermons on the Pentateuch</a>. 
                    <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> item is expanded to include all five of these handmade pamphlets, only one of which was known to <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>; 
                    and she situates it following MS II, another handmade pamphlet with sermon content, and which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had included in his original &#x201C;Note.&#x201D;
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Reverential of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> as <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> was, she recognized that his original &#x201C;Note&#x201D; contained dating errors; 
                    and so in order to preserve his Roman-numeral nomenclature, while also correcting, yet remaining faithful to the spirit of his chronological ordering of manuscripts, 
                    Viljoen layered a Roman-numeral <i>re</i>ordering over top of <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> original Roman-numeral designations. 
                    Thus, &#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood&#x201D; proposes a sequence identifying manuscripts as follows:
                    
         <ul>
            
            <li>I. MS No. I</li>
            
            <li>II. MS No. IA</li>
            
            <li>III. MS No. III</li>
            
            <li>IV. MS No. IIIA</li>
            
            <li>V. MS No. II</li>
            
            <li>VI. MSS Nos. IIA, B, C, D, E</li>
            
            <li>VII. MS No. IV</li>
            
         </ul>
                    And so on, in which the first Roman numeral in a given entry represents <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> attempt a chronological reordering, 
                    while the second (the manuscript number per se) is drawn either from <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> original scheme or represents <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> insertion 
                    of a manuscript into that scheme. (<span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> wanted nothing to do with <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> insertions, so she ignored their assignation of &#x201C;MS IA&#x201D; 
                    to the collection of manuscripts that they bound under that name, and instead assigned &#x201C;MS IA&#x201D; to the manuscript of &#x201C;The Puppet Show,&#x201D; which <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> 
                    called &#x201C;MS IB.&#x201D;)
                
      </p>
      
      <p>Whatever the other merits of <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> &#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood,&#x201D; her solution for naming and numbering manuscripts fails to lend clarity to what 
                    was already a losing proposition of ordering objects linearly that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not use in that fashion. 
                    He protracted use of some manuscripts over several years, 
                    and he overwrote others, building up layers of chronological sequence within a given manuscript. 
                    Fortunately, electronic publication provides alternatives to linear ordering 
                    (see <a href="../notes/plan_of_archive" target="_blank" class="inactive">Plan of the Archive</a>).
                
      </p>
      
      <p>As for <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> and <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> accretions of manuscript designations to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</span> &#x201C;Note,&#x201D; 
                    the practice in <i>ERM</i> is, in any case, to document fully as possible the history of naming manuscripts and works in the &#x201C;Title&#x201D; sections 
                    of apparatuses, while for hyperlinking purposes to use short titles for which a clear trail exists in bibliography and scholarship. 
                    Therefore, manuscripts are designated by Roman numeral if they were assigned one either in Collingwood&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Note,&#x201D; 
                    or in <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> revision of the &#x201C;Note&#x201D; for the 
                    <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a>. 
                    Since <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> additional Roman-numeral designations (and even <i>re</i>designation, in one case) were never published, 
                    <i>ERM</i> prefers the short discursive titles established in <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> bibliography (III.B.<i>b</i>), 
                    titles that typically are also reflected in the provenance of modern bindings, sales catalogs, and library catalogs for the collections that ultimately 
                    preserved these manuscripts.
                
      </p>
      
      <p>An exception is 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msjc_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IIIA</a>, for which <i>ERM</i> accepts <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</span> title. 
                    Although its provenance can be traced in 
                    <a href="../notes/provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sotheby&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1930</a>, 
                    this <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a> was not listed or named in <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</span> bibliography, 
                    and <span class="persName-HGV">Viljoen</span> appears to have been the first to name the manuscript.
