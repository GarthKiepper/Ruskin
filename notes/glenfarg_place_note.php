      <p>A glen in <span class="placeName-PERTHSHIRE">Perthshire</span>, approximately four miles in length, that follows the <span class="geogName-FARG">River Farg</span>.
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote two
                    poems about the glen, <a href="../apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</span></a>

      <p>In <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SCOTTISHTOURIST" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-guidebook-SCOTTISHTOURIST-italic">The Scottish Tourist, and Itinerary</span></a>
                    (<span class="date-1825">1825</span>; 3d ed., <span class="date-1830">1830</span>), a guidebook available at the time of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poems, <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> is described
                    as &#x201C;a romantic little valley embosomed by the <span class="placeName-OCHILS">Ochils</span>&#x201D; (p. 125). As treated in this guidebook,
                    which a scholar classes among &#x201C;short, portable books&#x201D; emerging in the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> that &#x201C;led readers on a series of
                    tours&#x201D; of <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TOURISMANDIDENTITY" target="_blank" class="inactive">Grenier, <span class="title-book-TOURISMANDIDENTITY-italic">Tourism and Identity in Scotland</span></a>,
                    66), <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span> was a place one visited, not when taking a day excursion from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, but when departing <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> altogether&#x2014;proceeding southward, on the way to
                    <span class="geogName-LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</span> and beyond. That this was the route taken by the Ruskins is supported by
                    <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-ONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</span></a>, which, describing a departure from
                    <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, crosses the <span class="geogName-EARN">River Earn</span>. Just so, according to 
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SCOTTISHTOURIST" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-guidebook-SCOTTISHTOURIST-italic">The Scottish Tourist, and Itinerary</span></a>, 
                    the traveler would go south from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> to
                    <span class="geogName-STRATHEARN">Strathearn</span>, cross the river at <span class="placeName-EARNBRG">Bridge of Earn</span> (an important crossing since the
                    <span class="date-0410-1516">Middle Ages</span>), and proceed to <span class="placeName-KINROSS">Kinross</span> and <span class="geogName-LOCHLEVEN">Loch Leven</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>The main feature in <span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span>, according to this guidebook, was the <span class="placeName-OCHILS">Ochils</span>: &#x201C;These hills are dwarfish when compared with the
                    lofty <span class="geogName-GRAMPIANS">Grampians</span>, and contrast with them in many respects. They present a smooth surface, and are clothed to
                    their summits with the deepest verdure, possessing also a pastoral serenity and softness, which give a new and pleasurable tone to
                    the mind of the tourist, who returns from contemplating the magnificence of Highland scenery&#x201D; (p. 125). The appeal of the
                    glen, therefore, appears to have lain in its modesty and domesticity rather than in the sublime grandeur that tourists typically
                    sought in the Scottish landscape.
      </p>
      
      <p>There were views to be captured, however. In an article on the <span class="placeName-PERTH">Parish</span> prepared for <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STATISTICALACCOUNT" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-reference-STATISTICALACCOUNT-italic">The New Statistical Account of Scotland</span></a>
                    (<span class="date-1845">1845</span>), a clergyman boasted that &#x201C;the prospect from <span class="placeName-GEDDES">Cairn Geddes</span>. . . is particularly splendid, comprehending the <span class="geogName-TAY">Frith of Tay</span>,
                    <span class="placeName-GOWRIE">Carse of Gowrie</span>, the <span class="placeName-SIDLAWS">Sidlaws</span>, terminating in <span class="placeName-MONCRIEFF">Moncrieff</span> and <span class="placeName-KINNOULL">Kinnoull</span> 
                    hills, the upper part of <span class="geogName-STRATHEARN">Strathearn</span>, and a considerable
                    portion of the <span class="geogName-GRAMPIANS">Grampian Range</span>&#x201D; (p. 883).
