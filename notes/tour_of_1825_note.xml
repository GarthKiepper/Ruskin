                <p>In <date when="1825">1825</date>, when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was six, the Ruskin family made its first visit to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>. 
                    According to <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, the family party included <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s nurse, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_anne_note.html"><persName corresp="#ASB">Anne Strachan</persName></ref>, who accompanied the family also on the <date when="1833">1833</date> journey; 
                    and they journeyed between <date notBefore="1825-05-11" notAfter="1825-07-13">11 May and 13 July</date>. 
                    The itinerary covered <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUGES">Bruges</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#GHENT">Ghent</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, including <placeName corresp="#VERSAILLES">Versailles</placeName>

                    As such, the tour was characteristically <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">post&#x2010;Napoleonic</date>, organized around paying tribute to the Allies&#x02BC; victory on <placeName corresp="WATERLOO">Waterloo Field</placeName>
                    and witnessing the festivities in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> to celebrate the crowning of <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles X</persName>.</p>
                
                <p>The route through <placeName corresp="#BRUGES">Bruges</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#GHENT">Ghent</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> was that taken by <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName>, when embarking on his exile in <date when="1816">1816</date>

                <p>The coronation of <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles X</persName> was the first since the restoration of the <orgName corresp="#BOURBONMONARCHY">Bourbon monarchy</orgName>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#KC10">Charles</persName>&#x02BC;s brother, <persName corresp="#KL18">Louis XVIII</persName>, 
                    having died after being restored to the throne less than a decade following the Allies&#x02BC; victory. The ceremony itself took place in <date when="1825-05">May</date> at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#REIMSCATHEDRAL">cathedral</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#REIMS">Reims</placeName>, 
                    where French monarchs had for centuries traditionally been anointed, and not in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, where <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> had crowned himself emperor in <placeName type="building" corresp="#NOTREDAMEDECALAIS">Notre Dame</placeName>. In <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain,</placeName> 
                    where <persName corresp="#KC10">Charles</persName> had lived in exile in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, theaters staged replicas of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#REIMSCATHEDRAL">Reims Cathedral</placeName> ceremony; and in <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, 
                    opera houses mounted productions that reflected the spectacle at <placeName corresp="#REIMS">Reims</placeName>, which was in itself deemed by many to be inappropriately operatic in character 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONQUELQUE"><persName corresp="#PHW">Walton</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WALTONQUELQUE">&#x201C;&#x2018;Quelque peu th&#x00E9;&#x00E2;tral&#x2019;&#x201D;</title>, 6&#x2013;10</ref>).</p>
                
                <p>In his travel diary for <date when="1833">1833</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> reflected back on this <date when="1825">1825</date> journey, 
                    comparing their experiences during the much more ambitious Continental <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.html">Tour of <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>. 
                    On this present visit, he notes that <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> was &#x201C;not so gay as in <date when="1825-05">May 1825</date>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RFMS33A"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFMS33A">Diary of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,<date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1846">1833&#x2013;46</date></title></ref>, 72, 73). 
                    In his autobiography, <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA">Praeterita</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> acknowledged that the trip was prompted by the coronation festivities, but he remembered nothing of the pomp, 
                    claiming to have been &#x201C;only interested by things near me, or at least clearly visible and present&#x201D;, such as the good&#x2010;natured servants at the <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> hotel 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"> <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:104).</p>
                
                <p>A journey to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> may seem ambitious for a middle&#x2010;class <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> family, only recently established (since <date when="1823">1823</date>) in their new suburban home, 
                    <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, and with a young boy to raise and educate. By the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, however, 
                    <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossings were common, if limited to the nearby and comparatively inexpensive destination of the <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Kingdom of the Netherlands</placeName> 
                    (<placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> did not secede and form a nation until <date when="1830">1830</date>). Trips expressly to view the <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> battlefield
                    had been popular since as early as the weeks immediately following the battle. The popularity had been enhanced by personal visits paid by such well&#x2010;known literary figures as 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, and <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#FRANCOIS1815">Fran&#x00E7;ois, <title type="essay" corresp="#FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s <date when="1815">1815</date>, This Must Be <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>&#x201D;</title></ref>, 74&#x2013;75, 89). 
                    The year of the Ruskins&#x02BC; crossing is noted as a watershed for middle&#x2010;class British travel by historians studying the opening of <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>, 
                    <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, and northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, 
                    since more rapid crossings were made possible by the rise of steam packet lines. The steam packets accommodated large excursion parties along with individual travelers, 
                    providing amenities such as food and drink and even entertainment, with music performance being common onboard 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#WILLIAMSARMSTRONGSTEAM"><persName corresp="#DMWILLIAMS">Williams</persName> and <persName corresp="#JARMSTRONG">Armstrong</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#WILLIAMSARMSTRONGSTEAM">&#x201C;Steam Shipping and the Beginnings of Overseas Tourism&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                    For travelers of modest means, the steam lines greatly increased the efficiency, reliability, and carrying capacity, improvements that were critical 
                    for travelers who could take holidays from employment only on a limited budget and for definite periods&#x2014;a point expressly made by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> in <date when="1825-03">March 1825</date>, 
                    determined to &#x201C;chuse Summer in future for any little Travelling&#x201D; with his family, since he suffered chill, weariness, and loneliness from his business travel during the autumn and winter months
