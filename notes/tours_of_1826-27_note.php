      <div class="title">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</div>
      
      <p>According to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, 
                    the family holidayed in <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>, a journey from <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> to <span class="placeName-SUSSEX">Sussex</span>
                    that presumably took place in <span class="date-1826">1826</span> prior to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composing his &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;
                    narrative, although it is possible that the story refers to a previous season. Seaside resorts attracted the Ruskins 
                    from nearly <span class="date-1818">the start of their marriage</span>, probably for their salubriousness to health as well as for pleasure 
                    (see <a href="../notes/seaside_resorts_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-SEASIDE">Seaside Resorts</span></a>, and see also

         <span class="head-subsection">Scotland, 1826, 1827, or both?</span>
         
         <p>The destinations of the <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> family tours of <span class="date-1826">1826</span> and <span class="date-1827">1827</span> were established by
                    <span class="persName-WGC">W. G. Collingwood</span> in <a href="../notes/poems_1891_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</a>; 
                    and while the dates of those tours were revised, and the destinations refined, by subsequent editors and biographers, the broad assumptions have not been
                    challenged. Those assumptions rest, however, on possibly confusing evidence in the <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Books</a>, 
                    and it may be that evidence referring apparently to two separate northern journeys, of <span class="date-1826">1826</span> and of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, in fact refer
                    to a single tour of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p><span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> took as his first point of reference the poems <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</a>
                    and <a href="../apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</a>. 
                    The former, he declared, &#x201C;record&#x005B;s <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s&#x005D; impressions received during a journey from
                    <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> with his parents, after visiting his <span class="persName-JRP">aunt</span> at <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>&#x201D;
                    in <span class="date-1826">1826</span>. Specifically, he believed, the poem captured the return journey, given the poem&#x02BC;s trope of changes: one
                    line &#x201C;is no doubt a reminiscence of the <span class="date-1826-05">May</span> sunshine in which they went northwards; for their start was usually made about the middle of May; and
                    &#x005B;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x005D; contrasts the sunny anticipation of the arrival with the autumnal gloom of the departure&#x201D;
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>,
                    1:xxii&#x2013;xxiii; <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;8<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:ix). On the
                    strength of this interpretation, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> renamed this poem &#x201C;Farewell
                    to Scotland&#x201D; (see <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php#TITLE" target="_blank">&#x201C;To Scotland&#x201D;: Title</a>).
         </p>
         
         <p>The latter portion of this interpretation, at the very least, has been disproved by <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span>, who points out
                    that, in <span class="date-1826-05">May 1826</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> was on the road
                    beyond his <span class="date-1826-05-10">10 May</span> birthday, as attested by his dated letters to <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> extending through the end of the month.
                    Business had been lean that year, thus delaying a family holiday (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>,
                    137, 139 n. 1, 150 n. 5, 137).
         </p>
         
         <p>Moreover, further upsetting the family&#x02BC;s routine, in <span class="date-1826-04-1826-05">April and May</span> they
                    coped with the consumptive decline and death of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> cousin,
                    <a href="../notes/richardson_james_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James Richardson</span></a>, who had been living at
                    <a href="../notes/herne_hill_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span></a> while working at
                    <a href="../notes/ruskin_telford_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="orgName-RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</span></a>. 
                    By <span class="date-1826-04">April</span>, <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>&#x02BC;s health had declined so alarmingly that he returned to his family in 
                    <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, possibly escorted on this journey by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> and <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>. 
                    The youth died soon after his return, on <span class="date-1826-05-08">8 May</span>, a few days before <span class="date-1826-05-10"><span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s birthday</span>. 
                    When <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> learned of his nephew&#x02BC;s death, he was traveling in the northwest, and he did not return home until 
                    <span class="date-1826-05-25-1826-05-31">the end of May</span> at the earliest 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 139 n. 1, 149; see also 
                    <a href="../notes/richardson_james_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JRPSON">James Richardson &#x005B;1808&#x2013;26&#x005D;</span></a>).
         </p>
         
         <p><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> states that &#x201C;in <span class="date-1826-04">April</span> the Ruskins took . . . <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> 
                    back to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>,&#x201D; an inference that he presumably takes from <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    letter of <span class="date-1826-05-07-1826-05-08">7&#x2013;8 May</span>, in which she reflects on <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;journey up.&#x201D; <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> is reminding her husband that, on this journey, 
                    <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> &#x201C;had none of that spirit which youths of his age usually have,&#x201D; so that 
                    &#x201C;both you &#x0026; I had repeatedly asked him if he was quite sure he was happy and . . . he had assured us in the strongest terms he was.&#x201D; 
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s references are somewhat obscure; however, assuming that the elder Ruskins did make this journey 
                    to <span class="placeName-">Perth</span> along with <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>, would they have allowed <span class="persName-JR">John</span> 
                    to come along? Considering that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> admonished the boy&#x02BC;s mother, <span class="persName-JRP">Jessie Richardson</span>, 
                    &#x201C;that the children should not be much with . . . &#x005B;<span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>&#x005D; for fear
                    of infection&#x201D; (referring to his brothers and sisters), it seems unlikely that <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> would have risked exposing 
                    her own son. It seems equally unlikely that she would have wanted her son to remain close at hand where he might witness <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>&#x02BC;s death, 
                    since she felt &#x201C;next to convinced that worlds could not save him.&#x201D; She observed this &#x201C;when <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>
                    was at <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>,&#x201D; doubtless referring to the house of her sister, <span class="persName-BR">Bridget Richardson</span>. 
                    Thus, perhaps <span class="persName-JR">John</span> was left with his <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span> aunt, uncle, and cousins, while his parents 
                    carried <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span> to <span class="placeName-">Perth</span> 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 134 n. 3, 142).
         </p>
         
         <p>Did <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s fears prevent the family from journeying north in <span class="date-1826">1826</span> altogether, even later in the year? 
                    While <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> corrects <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s assumption that the Scottish journey occurred in <span class="date-1826-05">May</span>,
                    he relies on the same evidence as does <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> to affirm that &#x201C;the family probably went in <span class="date-1826-09">September&#x201D; 1826</span> 
                    to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 150 n. 5).
                    Both conclusions go back to the evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem, <a href="../apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</a>, 
                    and to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s belief that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> wrote it, like <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</a>, either 
                    &#x201C;during the journey home&#x201D; from a <span class="date-1826-03-20-1826-06-21">spring</span> tour to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> (which
                    certainly did not occur), &#x201C;or on his return &#x005B;to <span class="placeName-">London</span>&#x005D;, in <span class="date-1826-09">September</span>&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;4<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:xxiii;
                    <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Poems</i> &#x005B;8<sup>o</sup>, 1891&#x005D;</a>, 1:x).
         </p>
         
         <p>The <span class="date-1826-09">September</span> date comes originally, as <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> remarks, from an annotation by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret Ruskin</span> in <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a> attributing
                    &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;) to that month (<span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>, like <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>, attributes the gloss to
                    <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, but the hand is <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s). It is
                    possible that a <span class="date-1826-09">September</span> journey resulted not only in this poem but also in the entirety of <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a> 
                    (including the <a href="../apparatuses/msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I Poetry Anthology</a>,
                    which contains &#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;), since <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> noted her <span class="persName-JR">son</span> as having started 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a> at about that time, in <span class="date-1826-09-1826-10">September or October 1826</span> 
                    (see <a href="../apparatuses/the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Date</a>; and <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php#DATE" target="_blank">MS I: Date</a>). The 
                    available evidence does fit together tidily enough.
         </p>
         
         <p>Nonetheless, the circumstantial evidence, which can be read as supporting the traditional case, can also be read as supporting <i>only</i>
                    a northern tour of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, and not tours of both <span class="date-1826">1826</span> <i>and</i> <span class="date-1827">1827</span>. The problem is
                    that the only evidence of a northern journey contained in <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a> (the manuscript dated by <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> 
                    as <span class="date-1826-09-1827-01">September or October 1826 through January 1827</span>) 
                    is &#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;&#x2014;and that poem might be interpreted as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s elegy on
                    his cousin, <span class="persName-JRPSON">James</span>, rather than as a topographical poem based on eyewitness
                    travel. The contents of <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a> are principally taken up by <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</a>, 
                    and that tale is set entirely at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> except for a holiday at <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span>. That the family actually sought such a
                    holiday on the <span class="placeName-SUSSEX">Sussex</span> coast in <span class="date-1826-06-21-1826-09-22">summer 1826</span> is logical,
                    given <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s concerns over her <span class="persName-JJR">husband</span>&#x02BC;s overwork
                    and his distress about his <span class="persName-JRP">sister</span>&#x02BC;s children, and given <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s recommendation of summer sea bathing for health on previous occasions 
                    (see letters of <span class="date-1826-05-05">5 May 1826</span>, <span class="date-1826-05-07-1826-05-08">7&#x2013;8 May 1826</span>, and <span class="date-1819-06-23">23 June 1819</span>, 
                    in <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 138, 141, 95).
         </p>
         
         <p>A <span class="date-1826-06-21-1826-09-22">summer</span> holiday on the coast would not have precluded a <span class="date-1826-09-22-1826-12-21">fall</span> journey
                    northward; and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s trope of &#x201C;change&#x201D; in &#x201C;On Scotland,&#x201D; could have been suggested by a number of disorientations
                    he would have experienced in <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>&#x2014;not only the absence of his deceased <span class="persName-JRPSON">cousin</span>, but possibly also the removal of his <span class="persName-JRP">aunt</span>&#x02BC;s
                    family from <span class="placeName-BRIDGEEND">Bridge End House</span> on the east bank of the <span class="geogName-TAYRIV">Tay River</span>, a house that was sold in <span class="date-1826-05">May 1826</span> in settling the estate of 
                    <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s uncle, the late <a href="../notes/richardson_patrick_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Patrick Richardson</a>, leaving the family with 
                    <span class="placeName-ROSETER">Rose Terrace</span> on the west side of the river, a house overlooking the <span class="placeName-NORTHINCH">North Inch</span> 
                    (although this move may have occurred earlier, following <span class="persName-PR">Patrick</span>&#x02BC;s death in <span class="date-1824">1824</span>; 
                    see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 48 n. 1, 101 n. 2, and plates VIII, IX).
         </p>
         
         <p>Still, there is no question that the Scottish connections are strongest in <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a>, belonging to <span class="date-1827">1827</span>. 
                    In <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</a>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> describes a visit to 
                    <span class="placeName-ROSETER">Rose Terrace</span>; and both of his poems about <a href="../notes/glenfarg_place_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="geogName-GLENFARG">Glenfarg</span></a>&#x2014;the valley
                    through which the family traveled to approach and/or depart from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>&#x2014;are contained in that <a href="../notes/red_book_note.php" target="_blank">Red Book</a>. 
                    Both poems, albeit in separate anthologies in <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS III</a>, could date from <span class="date-1827-09-1827-12">late 1827</span> (see
                    <a href="../apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</a> and

                    In fact, &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;) seems remarkably
                    sophisticated compared to poems of <span class="date-1826-1827">1826&#x2013;27</span> in <a href="../apparatuses/msi_apparatus.php" target="_blank">MS I</a>. It is only
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s dating of that poem as <span class="date-1826-09">September 1826</span> that lends credence to a
                    journey to that region in that year.
         </p>
         
         <p>In the introduction to <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TOURLAKES" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> and <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, eds., <i>Tour of the Lakes</i></a>,
                    <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> rehearses the same set of poems not only as evidence for an <span class="date-1826">1826</span> <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> journey, but also 
                    a visit to the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span> annexed to the same trip (&#x201C;by way of <span class="placeName-CONISTON">Coniston</span> and <span class="placeName-KESWICK">Keswick</span>&#x201D;)
                    on the evidence of <a href="../apparatuses/on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwentwater&#x201D;</a>. 
                    That poem, however, as <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> himself points out, was misdated as <span class="date-1828">1828</span> by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s earlier editors, belonging in fact to
                    <span class="date-1829">1829</span>. The poem proves nothing, therefore, about the case for an <span class="date-1826">1826</span> northern tour;
                    nor does the remark <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span> quotes by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in a <span class="date-1827-02-21">21 February 1827</span> letter to
                    <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, referring to &#x201C;our delightful Journey together,&#x201D; which may
                    refer&#x2014;not to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> and the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span>, as <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>
                    assumes&#x2014;but merely to the <span class="placeName-HASTINGS">Hastings</span> visit indicated in &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1 
                    (although the remark does seem to refer to a journey taken in the previous year, <span class="date-1826">1826</span>; 
                    see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 152; and

         </p>
         
         <p>All of this is to say that some skepticism is warranted about the dates and destinations of the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s earlier tours, evidence for which has, 
                    for more than a century, turned on the dating of a few poems. Ultimately, the case hinges on <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>&#x02BC;s gloss of 
                    <a href="../apparatuses/glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</a> 
                    as <span class="date-1826-09">September 1826</span>, and we cannot know precisely what she intended by that date. We also lack firm evidence about the itinerary: 
                    if <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s remark to his <span class="persName-MR">wife</span> about &#x201C;our delightful Journey together&#x201D; 
                    does refer to a northern journey in <span class="date-1826-09">September 1826</span>&#x2014;and, writing in <span class="date-1827-02">February 1827</span>,
                    he does seem to imply a recent journey&#x2014;on what evidence do we conclude that this journey included the <span class="geogName-LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</span>?

                    the <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye Valley</span> in southern <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>, 
                    followed by the ride north to <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> in <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>. 
                    Since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin from <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span>, 
                    <a href="../notes/mary_richardson_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Mary Richardson (<span class="date-1815-1849">1815&#x2013;49</span>)</a>, 
                    had been staying with the Ruskins at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>, and was still living in the house in <span class="date-1827-05">May</span>, 
                    it seems likely that she traveled with the family in order to return home to <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 156&#x2013;57).
         </p>
         
         <p>With <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> occupied by his business travels for orders well beyond his <span class="date-1827-05-10">10 May birthday</span>, 
                        the family could not have departed on holiday earlier than <span class="date-1827-05-21-1827-06-04">late May or early June 1827</span> and possibly later&#x2014;<span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span> 
                        advising her husband on <span class="date-1827-05-15">May 15</span> against &#x201C;coming home&#x201D; too early only &#x201C;to have to go away&#x201D; 
                        again on business and thereby &#x201C;increase your fatigue by bringing you twice over the same ground&#x201D; before he could consider work completed 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 157 n. 1, 166&#x2013;67). 
                        <span class="persName-JR">John</span> expressed his wanderlust with poems sent to his <span class="persName-JJR">father</span> in a letter of <span class="date-1827-05">May 1827</span>, 
                        prior to the holiday&#x2014;the poems, 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/wales_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</span></a> and

                        indicating that the itinerary was already planned.
         </p>
         
         <p>According to the prose account of the journey in <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-lesson-HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</span></a>, 
                        the itinerary took the Ruskins first to <span class="placeName-SALTHILL">Salt Hill</span>, a major stage west of <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span>, opening to the <span class="placeName-GWR">Great West Road</span>; 
                       however, rather than heading west toward <span class="placeName-BRISTOL">Bristol</span>, 
                        the Ruskins turned northwest to <span class="placeName-OXFORD">Oxford</span>, 
                        where they stayed briefly to view the colleges. They proceeded through <span class="placeName-GLOUCESTER">Gloucester</span>, presumably on a straight path to <span class="placeName-ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</span>, 
                        an established launching place for a tour of the <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye Valley</span>, but 
                        Ruskin&#x02BC;s account next mentions <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span>. It is not clear, therefore, whether the prose account accurately describes the sequence of the itinerary. 
                        Ruskin describes <span class="placeName-TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</span> at length, followed by a reference to <span class="placeName-WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</span>&#x2013;one of the eminences surrounding the dramatic bend in the river that 
                        encloses the peninsula of <span class="placeName-LANCAUT">Lancaut</span>&#x2013;but the narrative neglects to mention <span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</span>, which figures prominently as the subject of Ruskin&#x02BC;s poem 
                       in <a href="../apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">Poetry Discriptive</span></a>. 
                        Thus, it seems likely that the travel narrative and poetry anthology are governed less by concerns for accuracy, like a memoir, 
                        than by the high points of picturesque viewing (indeed, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; purports to be a fictionalized lesson in the manner the Edgeworths&#x02BC; series of lessons, 
                        and not autobiographical; see <a href="../apparatuses/msiii_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION" target="_blank">MS III: Discussion</a>). 
                       <span class="placeName-WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</span>, for example, was known primarily as a picturesque spot&#x2013;one 
                        of the elevated views over the river from the Piercefield estate, 
                        famous for its picturesque walks developed during the age of <span class="persName-CAPABILITY">Capability Brown</span> (<span class="date-1716-1783">1716&#x2013;83</span>) 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Andrews, <i>Search for the Picturesque</i></a>, 105&#x2013;7).
         </p>
         
         <p>Wearied with another challenging year for his business, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> perhaps welcomed an excursion through the 
                        <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye Valley</span> which offered provisions for easy travel 
                        that had been honed to commercial efficiency by three&#x2010;quarters of a century of popular picturesque viewing. 
                        From the <span class="date-1760-1800">1760s through the turn of the century</span>, the preferred modes for experiencing the dramatic features 
                        along the craggy banks of the river were by water or by foot 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Andrews, <i>Search for the Picturesque</i>, 84&#x2013;107</a>). 
                        By the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, however, the Ruskins would have benefitted from easier carriage access 
                        owing to road improvements, including a new turnpike from <span class="placeName-CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</span> and a carriageway from <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span> to <span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</span>; 
                        and in the year of their journey, the Ruskins could have observed an industrial&#x2010;age iron bridge under construction at <span class="placeName-BIGSWEIR">Bigsweir</span>, 
                        midway between <span class="placeName-TINTERN">Tintern</span> and <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span>. If they left their carriage for a water excursion, 
                        they could have embarked on one of the steam packets that had been operating throughout the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MATHESONHEATH" target="_blank" class="inactive">Matheson, &#x201C;Charles Heath and the <i>Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Tintern Abbey</i>&#x201D;</a>, 141).
         </p>
         
         <p>Insofar as the sequence of landmarks in <a href="../apparatuses/harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</a>, can be trusted, 
                        the family took the length of the <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye Valley</span> excursion at least from <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span> to <span class="placeName-TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</span> 
                        (the tour normally departing from <span class="placeName-">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</span> and ending at <span class="placeName-CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</span>). 
                        At <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span>, a short ride would have brought the visitors to <span class="placeName-RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</span>, 
                        prompting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <a href="../apparatuses/ragland_castle_apparatus.php" target="_blank">poem of that name</a>. 
                         includes a drawing entitled 
                        <a href="../drawings/bristol_channel_drawing_msiii.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Picture of the Bristol Channel&#x201D;</a>, 
                        showing open water crowded with both large ships under full sail and smoking steamboats, so it appears likely that the Ruskins continued 
                        to <span class="placeName-CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</span> and even beyond into the <span class="geogName-BRISTOLCHANNEL">Bristol Channel</span>.
         </p>
         
         <p>To guide them on the <span class="geogName-WYE">Wye</span> tour, the Ruskins are likely to have used an edition of the guidebook, 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HEATHRAGLANDCASTLE" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Ragland Castle</i></a> 
                        by the <span class="placeName-MONMOUTH">Monmouth</span> printer, <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Charles Heath</span> (<span class="date-1761-1830">1761&#x2013;1830</span>), 
                        and possibly also his <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HEATHTINTERN" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-guidebook-HEATHTINTERN-italic">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Tintern Abbey</span></a>. 
                        Not only were these guidebooks popular and widely available, but there is also evidence of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s close attention to <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Heath</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        approach to interpreting the castle and abbey ruins. A drawing in 
                         is entitled 
                        <a href="../drawings/ragland_castle_drawing_msiii.jpg" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Ragland Castle When Newly Built&#x201D;</a>, an idea that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        may have borrowed from <span class="title-guidebook-HEATHRAGLANDCASTLE-italic">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Ragland Castle</span>, 
                        in which <span class="persName-CHMONMOUTH">Heath</span> organizes information under the two heads, 
                        &#x201C;The Castle in Its Present State, as It Is Now Shewn&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Castle in Its Splendor&#x201D;&#x2014;the latter 
                        reconstructing the castle&#x02BC;s past state, &#x201C;when newly built,&#x201D; as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> puts it.

               without explaining how the Ruskins traveled there from <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>&#x2014;except, &#x201C;&#x201D; says, that they went by sea on a steamboat. 
               Unless the sea voyage is entirely fanciful, this crossing or coastal sailing 
                        presumably occurred on the eastern side of <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> omitting an account of the northeastern journey from <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span>. 
               This leg of the tour would have presented an opportunity
