                        <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> first appeared in <span class="date-1823">1823</span>, for the holiday season of <span class="date-1823-11-1824-02">1823&#x2013;24</span>, 
                        only one year after the very first of the British annuals, 
                        <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, was published by the firm of <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Rudolf Ackermann</span> in <span class="date-1822">1822</span>, for the holiday season of <span class="date-1822-11-1823-02">1822&#x2013;23</span> 
                        (see <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</a>). 
                        According to the bibliography of the annuals, 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Faxon, <span class="title-bibliography-FAXONLITERARYANNUALS"><i>Literary Annuals</i></span></a>, 
                        <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> kept up annual publication through the volume for <span class="date-1844">1844</span> (p. 95).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>In the wake of <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span>&#x02BC;s outstanding success, <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> was published 
                        by <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Lupton Relfe</span>, a bookseller in <span class="placeName-CORNHILL">Cornhill</span>. According to an <span class="date-1858">1858</span> reflection on the heyday of annuals, 
                        <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>&#x02BC;s product was &#x201C;unpromising&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANNUALSOFFORMERDAYS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;The Annuals of Former Days&#x201D;</a>, 496), 
                        although this judgment may be colored by the annual&#x02BC;s subsequent success under a new publisher. 
                        That there was some upheaval afoot appears evident from the prefatory remarks by the new editor for the <span class="date-1826">1826</span> volume, <span class="persName-TKH">T. K. Hervey</span> (<span class="date-1799-1859">1799&#x2013;1859</span>), 
                        who acknowledges &#x201C;difficulties&#x201D; arising from the annual having, &#x201C;very recently, come into the present Editor&#x02BC;s hands 
                        with a view to an entire change in its character and plan&#x201D; 
                        (, v). 
                        In any case, in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> the annual was taken over by the relatively young publishing firm of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>.
                    
         </p> 
         
         <p><span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> released their first volume of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> &#x201C;for&#x201D; <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, under the editorship of <span class="persName-CK">Charles Knight</span> (<span class="date-1791-1873">1791&#x2013;1873</span>), 
                        who was then struggling to establish himself in <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publishing. 
                        <span class="persName-CK">Knight</span> was succeeded in the following year by <span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span>&#x2014;the editor who would later introduce <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> to the fashionable world as the author, &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">J.R.</span>&#x201D;
                        <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> strikingly improved the annual&#x02BC;s material appeal, and 
                        sales rose, eventually peaking at ten thousand copies per year 
                        (by comparison, <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> in some years achieved twenty thousand). The fortunes of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> were assured 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SMITHDNB" target="_blank" class="inactive">Bell, &#x201C;Smith, George Murray (1824&#x2013;1901)&#x201D;</a>; 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ford, <i>Ackermann</i></a>, 65).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>The success of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>&#x02BC;s venture appears to have hinged on a striking physical presentation of binding and printing and on the appeal of the illustrations.
                        The first issue of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> under the new proprietorship received a complementary notice in  
                        <span class="title-periodical-MIRROROFLITERATURE-italic">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</span>, 
                        the review focusing first on the &#x201C;exterior, which is somewhat novel in taste, . . . by substituting for the usual paper covering 
                        &#x005B;i.e., like the printed paper boards covering the <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>&#x005D;, an elegantly embossed leather binding. 
                        This is altogether an improvement on the original plan, since the slight coverings of silk or paper is scarcely safe out of the drawing&#x2010;room or boudoir, 
                        and some of the contributions to the &#x2018;annuals&#x2019; entitle them to a higher stand&#x201D;
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SPIRITOFTHEANNUALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Spirit of &#x2018;The Annuals&#x2019; for 1828&#x201D;</a>, 418). 
                        The binding of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> featured an arabesque design that was blind embossed into the full surface of the dark leather cover, 
                        with a lyre design blocked in gilt in the center of the front cover. As <span class="persName-EJ">Eleanore Jamieson</span> remarks in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-JAMIESONBINDINGSTYLES">&#x201C;The Binding Styles of the Gift Books and Annuals&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                        the arabesque pattern was regarded as a revival style hearkening to the early book, 
                        and the style was associated with Continental models
                        (p. 11; and see <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-bibliography-ANNUALSANDOTHER">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</span></a>).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>The annuals dueled to be judged by their covers, the <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span> firm&#x02BC;s <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> having set an initial standard with its printed and glazed paper boards, 
                        cloth spine, and slipcase, later replaced by a silk cover 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ford, <span class="title-biography-FORDACKERMAN"><i>Ackermann</i></span></a>, 65).  
                        Innovation and extravagance&#x2014;or at least the appearance of extravagance&#x2014;in bindings and engraved front matter became characteristic of annuals, 
                        which used this immediate source of appeal to compete in a crowded market 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FAXONLITERARYANNUALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Faxon, <span class="title-bibliography-"><i>Literary Annuals</i></span></a>, xiv&#x2013;xvi). 
                        Perhaps the <span class="title-periodical-MIRROROFLITERATURE-italic">Mirror of Literature</span> was also commenting on the sturdier content, and not just the cover, 
                        of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>, in suggesting that embossed leather would hold up outside the boudoir.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>The other notable source of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>&#x02BC;s success, the quality of illustration, 
                        was the special care of one partner in the young firm, <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> (<span class="date-1790-1876">1790&#x2013;1876</span>). 
                        According to <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Huxley, <i>House of Smith Elder</i></a>, 
                        <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> was interested in art, and aspired to produce elegantly illustrated publications (p. 10). 
                        Illustration was key to the popularity of the annuals, as <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> would have realized from the precedent set by <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span>&#x02BC;s success. 
                        The first issue of <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> had featured a series of emblematic treatments of the twelve months, rendered in copper etching, 
                        along with verses by <span class="persName-WC">William Combe</span> (<span class="date-1742-1823">1742&#x2013;1823</span>). 
                        <span class="persName-WC">Combe</span> was well known as the author of 
                        <span class="title-poem-TOUROFDOCTORSYNTAX-italic">The Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of the Picturesque</span> (<span class="date-1812">1812</span>, <span class="date-1820">1820</span>, <span class="date-1821">1821</span>), 
                        a spoof illustrated by <span class="persName-TR">Thomas Rowlandson</span> (<span class="date-1757-1827">1757&#x2013;1827</span>). 
                        This illustrated work ranked among the <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span> firm&#x02BC;s greatest best&#x2010;sellers 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#FORDACKERMANN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ford, <i>Ackermann</i></a>, 52&#x2013;60); 
                        and by employing <span class="persName-WC">Combe</span> along with an illustrator on the new publication, <span class="persName-RAP">Rudolph Ackermann</span> 
                        was probably striving to maintain this popularity.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>In some respects, however, the illustrated emblems of the months in <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> 
                        looked backward to an <span class="date-1701-1800">eighteenth&#x2010;century</span> tradition, rather than forward to new fashions. Copper engraving 
                        was soon to be displaced by more durable steel engraving, which would allow for much larger press runs; and the very inclusion of a monthly calendar hearkened 
                        to the gift annual&#x02BC;s beginnings in the eighteenth&#x2010;century &#x201C;pocket book&#x201D; 
                        (see <a href="../notes/annuals_note.php" target="_blank"> <span class="title-bibliography-ANNUALSANDOTHER">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</span></a>). 
                        The second volume of <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, featured much more varied pictorial scenes (albeit with mausoleums predominating), 
                        which were highlighted in the front matter by a list of plates 
                        that stood separately from the literary table of contents. The dual tables of contents&#x2014;emblematic of the growing importance of visual culture in the early Victorian period&#x2014;remained typical of annuals thereafter 
                        (see the facsimiles of <i>Forget Me Not</i> available in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HARRISFORGETMENOT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Harris, ed., <span class="title-archive-HARRISFORGETMENOT"><i>&#x201C;Forget Me Not&#x201D; Archive</i></span></a>).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>This is how <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> stood in <span class="date-1826-1827">1826&#x2013;27</span>, when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        aunt, <a href="../notes/richardson_bridget_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-BR">Bridget Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1783-1830">1783&#x2013;1830</span>)</a>, 
                        of <span class="placeName-CROYDON">Croydon</span>, presented him with the volume for <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, containing &#x201C;<span class="title-engraving-PROUTMONUMENTATVERONAIMAGE">Monument at Verona</span>,&#x201D; 
                        by <a href="../notes/prout_samuel_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-SP">Samuel Prout</span> (<span class="date-1783-1852">1783&#x2013;1852</span>)</a> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <span class="title-anthology-"><i>Works</i></span></a>, 35:91). 
                        Engraved by <span class="persName-EFF">Edward Finden</span> (<span class="date-1791-1857">1791&#x2013;1857</span>), 
                        this plate would have among the early steel engravings produced by the <a href="../notes/finden_brothers_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Finden brothers</a> 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hunnisett, <span class="title-essay-HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED"><i>Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</i></span></a>, 84&#x2013;85). 
                        <span class="orgName-ACKERMANN">Ackermann</span>&#x02BC;s annual had now caught up with the technology of steel engraving for book illustration, 
                        which proved key to the success of the annuals. As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, 
                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. 
                        These developments coincided with <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i>.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p><span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>&#x02BC;s <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. 
                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. At the same time, 
                        a comparison of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <span class="persName-LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</span>, 
                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. 
                        <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> did expand the title, however, from <span class="orgName-RELFE">Relfe</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-anthology-"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</i></span> to 
                        <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</i>.  
                        In <span class="date-1833">1833</span>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <i>Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</i>, 
                        which had been published in <span class="placeName-LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</span> since <span class="date-1828">1828</span>. This merger resulted in the title, 
                        <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</i> (so the title appears on the typeset title page; 
                        for a time, the engraved frontispiece with the earlier title remained in production). 
                        This latest title was in use when <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> first appeared in the annual, in the issue, 
                        <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath: A Christmas and New Year&#x02BC;s Present for <span class="smallcaps">MDCCCXXXV</span></i>.

         <p>The founders of the new firm, <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> and <span class="persName-GS">George Smith</span> (<span class="date-1789-1846">1789&#x2013;1846</span>), were Scotsmen; 
                        and this connection, along with <span class="persName-GS">Smith</span>&#x02BC;s apprenticeship in the publishing house of <span class="orgName-MURRAY">John Murray</span>, the publisher of <span class="persName-GGB">Byron</span>, 
                        would have been important to <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, who was of course a Scot himself, 
                        and whose counting house in the city was situated close to that of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>

                        Among <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>&#x02BC;s early successes were ambitious illustrated works on <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, such as a series of engraved views of the principal towns. 
                        <span class="persName-GH">Gillian Hughes</span> suggests that <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> in particular was a central figure for the expatriate group of literary Scotsmen in London during the 
                        <span class="date-1820-1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</span>
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUGHESINTROHOGGANNUALS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Introductory and Textual Notes&#x201D;</a>, 309). 
                        Gathered around <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span> were a number of Scottish literary men 
                        who were proving their way in the burgeoning <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> publishing market&#x2014;men such as <span class="persName-LR">Leitch Ritchie</span> (<span class="date-1800-1865">1800&#x2013;1865</span>) and 
                        <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span> (<span class="date-1789-1834">1789&#x2013;1834</span>)</a>. 
                        It would have mattered to the Ruskins that <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s editorship of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</i> 
                        had been appreciately noticed in the &#x201C;<span class="title-series-NOCTESAMBROSIANAE">Noctes Ambrosianae</span>&#x201D; of <span class="title-periodical-BLACKWOODSMAGAZINE"><i>Blackwood&#x02BC;s Edinburgh Magazine</i></span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HUXLEYHOUSEOFSMITHELDER" target="_blank" class="inactive">Huxley, <i>House of Smith Elder</i></a>, 10&#x2013;11;

         </p>
         
         <p>Starting his editorship in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s first volume of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> was  
                        that for <span class="date-1829">1829</span> (i.e., marketed during the holiday season of <span class="date-1828-11-1829-01">1828&#x2013;29</span>). He served 
                        as editor until his death in <span class="date-1834-12">December 1834</span>, having prepared the volume for <span class="date-1835">1835</span> (i.e., for the holiday season of <span class="date-1834-11-1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</span>). 
                        This last volume, which featured the young <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, was substantially completed during the <span class="date-1834-06-21-1834-09-22">summer of 1834</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#VIGNEPRINGLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Vigne, <i>Thomas Pringle</i></a>, 244). In this volume, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> made his first 
                        appearance in a prominent professional anthology, publishing two poems: <a href="../witnesses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;<span class="title-poem-FRAGMENTS">Fragments from a Metrical Journal</span>,&#x201D;</a>, 
                        which was abstracted from his <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>; and 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;<span class="title-poem-SALTZBURG">Saltzburg</span>&#x201D;</a>, which accompanied an engraved vedute of the city, drawn by

                        and engraved by <a href="../notes/goodall_edward_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-EG">Edward Goodall</span> (<span class="date-1795-1870">1795&#x2013;1870</span>)</a> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING1835" target="_blank" class="inactive">Pringle, ed., <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering; and Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath . . . for 1835</i></a>, 37&#x2013;38, 317&#x2013;19). 
                        <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span>&#x02BC;s relationship with the Ruskin family was struck considerably earlier than his editing of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> for the <span class="date-1834-11-1835-01">1834&#x2013;35</span> volume, 
                        for it was either his first volume, for <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, or his second, for <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, that was presented as a gift to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> in <span class="date-1829-10">October 1829</span> by his cousin, 
                        <a href="../notes/richardson_charles_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-CTR">Charles Thomas Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1811-1834">1811&#x2013;34</span>)</a>, 
                        who was an apprentice or shopboy with <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 208). 
                        Certainly, <span class="persName-TP">Pringle</span> was on a familiar footing 
                        with the family by <span class="date-1832-01">January 1832</span>, when he introduced the Ruskins to the writer, <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank">James Hogg (<span class="date-1770-1835">ca. 1770&#x2013;1835</span>)</a>.
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>It is interesting that an eighteen&#x2010;year&#x2010;old youth, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin, <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span>, deemed it appropriate to present a younger boy, aged ten, with <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> as a gift. 
                        It is even more surprising that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s aunt made him a gift of <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span> when he was only eight. Annuals were usually characterized as an appropriate gift for women, 
                        whereas the so&#x2010;called &#x201C;juvenile&#x201D; annuals formed a distinct commodity for children. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s mother, <span class="persName-MR">Margaret</span>, 
                        reacted to <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span>&#x02BC;s gift with disapproval of the publication&#x02BC;s poor educational influences: &#x201C;The plates are well done but they are not interesting&#x005B;;&#x005D; 
                        the tales are horrible enough&#x005B;;&#x005D; the poetry very so so I think&#x005B;;&#x005D;
                        upon the whole it does not improve&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, ed., <i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 208). 
                        In <span class="title-autobiography-PRAETERITA-italic">Praeterita</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> read the gift as prompted by <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span>&#x02BC;s pride 
                        in the material sumptuousness that his employers had bestowed on their newly acquired title: <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> 
                        &#x201C;took personal pride in everything produced by the firm,&#x201D; as Ruskin believed &#x201C;all right&#x2010;minded apprentices and good shopmen do&#x201D;; 
                        and it was in keeping with the reputation of <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span> 
                        for producing fine illustrated books that <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span> &#x201C;on Sundays always brought a volume or two in his pocket 
                        to show us the character of . . . &#x005B;the firm&#x02BC;s&#x005D; most ambitious publications; especially choosing, on my behalf, any which chanced to contain good engravings&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:91). It was the up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date materiality of <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> 
                        that could make this adult annual appealing to young people; and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> would demonstrate his engagement with modern technology of reproducible imagery in his 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php" target="_blank">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a> (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hanson, &#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s;&#x201D;</a>).
                    
         </p>
         
         <p>As later in the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s own handmade version of an illustrated book, <span class="persName-CTR">Charles</span>&#x02BC;s gift 
                        may also have testified to his young <span class="persName-JR">cousin</span>&#x02BC;s precocity, for there appears to be no evidence that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        condescended to be a consumer of the &#x201C;juvenile&#x201D; annuals, which were designed for his age group, 
                        and which began appearing between <span class="date-1828">1828</span> and <span class="date-1830">1830</span>&#x2014;precisely when he was presented with the more adult <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i> 
                        (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RENIERFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING" target="_blank" class="inactive">Renier, <i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></a>, 17). 
                        We can only guess at gift&#x2010;givers&#x02BC; motives, however. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-BR">aunt</span>&#x02BC;s present, 
                        the <span class="date-1827">1827</span> <span class="title-periodical-RAPFORGETMENOT-italic">Forget Me Not</span>, seems particularly marked by the Victorian sentiment of mourning. 
                        Its frontispiece, &#x201C;<span class="title-engraving-FINDENMOTHERSGRAVEIMAGE">The Mother&#x02BC;s Grave</span>&#x201D; (likewise engraved by <span class="persName-EFF">Edward Finden</span>) features a trio of children sweetly gazing at a churchyard tombstone; 
                        the contents include &#x201C;<span class="title-peom-ADIRGE">A Dirge</span>&#x201D; by <a href="../notes/croly_george_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-GCREV">George Croly</span> (<span class="date-1780-1860">1780&#x2013;1860</span>)</a>, 
                        who would later become an impressive guest at <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span> dinners; 
                        and <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s beloved plate by <span class="persName-SP">Prout</span> depicts, as <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> emphasizes in <span class="title-autobiography-PRAETERITA-italic">Praeterita</span>, 
                        a &#x201C;sepulchral&#x201D; monument 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 35:91;

                        It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="persName-BR">Aunt Bridget</span> meant the gift as a mourning momento 
                        for his <span class="placeName-PERTH">Perth</span> cousins, <a href="../notes/richardson_jessie_cousin_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JRPDAUGHTER">Jessie Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1820-1827">1820&#x2013;27</span>)</a>,
