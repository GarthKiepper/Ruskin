                <p>In 1826, following the death by consumption of Ruskin&#x02BC;s cousin, James Richardson<!-- add name tage and link to  his note -->, who had lived at Herne Hill, Margaret Ruskin declared a ban on

                    "and it seems to be her real desire to make herself useful and spare me trouble" in such tasks as sewing and shopping. 
                    Following the death of Mary's mother, Jessie Richardson, in May 1828, Mary's residence at Herne Hill became permanent until her marriage
