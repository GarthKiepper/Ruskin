            <p>Some revision of the poem for publication must have taken place <span class="date-1829-05-10-1829-08">between 10 May and August 1829</span>,

                            <span class="title-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;description of skiddaw &#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D;</span>, 
                            was likely &#x201C;that blank verse upon Lake Derwent&#x201D; that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> admitted he had &#x201C;demurred at bringing&#x201D; 
                            earlier to his father, as he recalled in the <span class="date-1829-05-10">10 May 1829</span> birthday letter 
                            (not a posted letter, by any external evidence, but a cover letter inscribed on the outside, in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                            as &#x201C;Birthday Odes &#x007C; To my dear Papa&#x201D;). On that earlier occasion, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> had temporized 
                            because the poem &#x201C;was designed for your birthday and I did not wish you to see it beforehand.&#x201D; He goes on to explain that 
                            there was even &#x201C;a line &#x005B;in the draft&#x005D; saying something about this happy day and I was afraid you would ask me what happy day and then the whole secret would 
                            gradually have been hauled out of my unwilling mouth&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 199). 
                            The evasive maneuveur that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> was recalling may have occurred about <span class="date-1829-04">April 1829</span>, 
                            when a gap in the surviving family letters possibly indicates that <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> was at home and not traveling for wine orders.
               </p>
               
               <p>Such a line about a &#x201C;happy day&#x201D; is indeed contained in the <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> draft,

                            at the end of first strophe, which describes <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">Skiddaw</span> (&#x201C;but no more . . . / on this sad subject on this happy day&#x201D; &#x005B;line 36&#x005D;). 
                            The line recurs in the fair&#x2010;copy version, <a href="../showcase/on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_msv.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            which is found in <a href="../apparatuses/battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                            On the occasion prior to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s birthday, to which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> refers, he apparently copied or recited a version that is not represented by extant copies, 
                            since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> writes that he &#x201C;found a way of evading this line as I found that when it was missed the poem sounded quite well without it&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200).
               </p>
               
               <p>As <span class="persName-VAB">Van Akin Burd</span> remarks, &#x201C;the poem &#x2018;Derwentwater,&#x2019; which was apparently sent to &#x005B;<span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x005D; as an enclosure with &#x005B;Ruskin&#x02BC;s 10 May 1829&#x005D; letter is no longer with it&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200 n. 2). 
                            However, since <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> inscribed the letter as &#x201C;Birthday Odes&#x201D;&#x2014;using the plural&#x2014;the presentation copy may not have been devoted solely to the 
                            topographical poem. Rather, the enclosure may have been the handmade booklet, 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            which contains the only surviving fair copy in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s hand. The description of the enclosure in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s letter matches this booklet more convincingly 
                            if one omits <span class="persName-VAB">Burd</span>&#x02BC;s bracketed editorial insertion: &#x201C;On Newyearsday I prepared a small poem for you,&#x201D; 
                            and therefore &#x201C;on your birthday it becomes me to have a much larger &#x005B;one&#x005D; for you&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 199). That is, by a &#x201C;larger,&#x201D; 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> may have meant, not just a single larger poem, but a larger project&#x2014;the handmade booklet, which he dated <span class="date-1829">1829</span> on its cover, and which contains 
                            along with the poem several other poems and a play. The pamphlet also precisely meets the inscription on the letter, &#x201C;Birthday Odes,&#x201D; 
                            since it includes a fair copy of another <span class="date-1829">1829</span> birthday poem, <a href="../apparatuses/may_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                            Finally, the rough draft, <span class="title-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSII">&#x201C;description of skiddaw &#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D;</span>, 
                            wraps around a fragment of text that may represent a brief idea for the play. 
                            Despite all this, one cannot discount the possibility that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1829-05-10">10 May 1829</span> letter once accompanied a fair&#x2010;copy version, 
                            presently unknown, which contained the topographical poem, perhaps paired with the second birthday ode, <span class="title-poem-MAY">&#x201C;May&#x201D;</span>.
               </p>
               
               <p>The poem is composed in blank verse, except for the final ten lines, given the heading &#x201C;conclusion&#x201D; in the rough draft, which are formed from rhymed octosyllabic couplets. 
                            Structurally, the rough draft works by strophes being added one to the next, using explicit transitions, such as 
                            &#x201C;Ive treated of the clouds. now <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW">skiddaw</span> come&#x201D; and &#x201C;Now <span class="geogName-DERWENTWATER">derwent water</span> come.&#x201D; 
                            Writing the the poem in stages, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> changed from pencil to pen, and from one color of ink to another. 
                            Twice, he interrupted composition of the poem with other texts. Given this structure of built&#x2010;up units over time, 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> perceived the draft as easily expandable, yet also as contractible&#x2014;as suggested by a deleted ninth line, seemingly a relic of a premature ending, 
                            &#x201C;Now hear my boyish moral.&#x201D; Yet the poem&#x02BC;s title indicates that, from the start, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> projected a complex poem. 
                            There is no evidence that he arrived seriatim at his compound subject of mountain and lake; rather, since the title shows no cramping on the page, 
                            as if &#x201C;&#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D; had been added as an afterthought, he appears to have conceptualized the &#x201C;description&#x201D; of mountain and of lake as &#x201C;reechoed&#x201D; 
                            and &#x201C;reflected&#x201D; in one another, as the final lines state the relation. Overall, the poem represents a sustained and ambitious effort.

                            and split into two poems for publication in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i>: A Monthly Magazine</span>. 
                            Thus, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first poem to appear in print, and his first publication of any kind, was 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland. &#x007C; <i>Derwentwater</i>&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            which was signed &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">R&#x2014;</span>&#x201D;, and which appeared in the <span class="date-1829-08-01">1 August 1829</span> (vol. 1, no. 4) issue. 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s second publication was 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent&#x2010;Water&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            which was signed &#x201C;<span class="persName-pen_name-JR">R.</span>&#x201D;, and which appeared in the <span class="date-1830-02">February 1830</span> (vol. 1, no. 10) issue. 
                            The responsibility and authority for the splitting and revision of the poem are unknown. As the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> speculate, 
                            the revision presumably was guided either by the magazine&#x02BC;s editor, 
                            the <a href="../notes/andrews_edward_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-EA">Reverend Edward Andrews (1787&#x2013;1841)</span></a>, 
                            or by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s father, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, or by both of them. 
                            Subsequent scholars have weighted the responsibility on the father&#x02BC;s side 
                            (see, e.g., <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#MAIDMENTONLYPRINT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Maidment, &#x201C;&#x2018;Only Print&#x2019;&#x201D;</a>, 196), 
                            but in fact no evidence survives to document the process of revision.
               </p>
               
               <p>Whoever was responsible, the <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland&#x201D;</span> was formed by isolating 
                            the final strophe of the original poem, which in the <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a> 
                            draft was designated by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> as the &#x201C;conclusion&#x201D; (beginning &#x201C;sweet derwent on thy winding shore.&#x201D;), 
                            and which is distinct from main body of the poem for its rhymed couplets.
                            (In the fair copy, contained in <a href="../apparatuses/battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            this concluding section is not subtitled, but it is marked by a horizontal bar above its first line.) 
                            The choice of these ten concluding lines as the first, separate publication can be explained by the revised dating of the poem. 
                            The Ruskins engaged <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> to tutor <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> starting in <span class="date-1829-04">April 1829</span>, 
                            only about five months prior to the <span class="date-1829-08">August</span> publication of <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</span> 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200); and presumably <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> 
                            would not have seen <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original poem prior to its presentation to <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                            on his <span class="date-1829-05-10">10 May</span> birthday. Thus, only a few months elapsed between when <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> 
                            likely first read the poem and when he would have needed to oversee its revision and printing. There was not enough time for revision of 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s entire original poem for the <span class="date-1829-08">August</span> publication date, 
                            although <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> apparently was so struck by the work that he decided to hurry the brief &#x201C;Lines&#x201D; into the soonest available issue.
               </p>
               
               <p>There was time enough, however, for several minor revisions and one major development of the text as found in both the 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a> draft and the fair copy presented in 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</span></a>.
                            The major change lies in the elaborated conclusion of the <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</span>, 
                            which transfers the reflection of lightning over <span class="geogName-HELVELLYN">Mount Helvellyn</span> from the outer surface of a &#x201C;mountain rill&#x201D; 
                            to an internalized play &#x201C;oe&#x02BC;r the Poet&#x02BC;s eye&#x201D; and warming of his &#x201C;heart.&#x201D; Yet despite this new Romantic turn, 
                            an additional moralizing couplet, which has no basis at all in the original, deprives the Poet of solace in nature: 
                            &#x201C;Though such thy glories Earth, thy proudest whole, / Can never satiate the grasping soul!&#x201D;
               </p>
               
               <p>The addition of such pieties was appropriate to the venue of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s journal (see <a href="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</a>). 
                            The process of revision that arrived at these pious sentiments may not have been easy, however, as reflected in a debate over the respective claims of worldly beauty and religious austerity, 
                            which is carried out in fragments that, in <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>,

                            As a proposed collected volume took shape in his mind, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> inclined at first to assembling only the poems published in

                            At some point, according to the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, <span class="persName-WHH">Harrison</span> presented

                            <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> proposed opening the volume with some poems composed at age twelve, which were family favorites; and he pressed his son to decide also if he wanted

                            While the family surely owned copies at one time, the issues may have gone missing by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s time, 
                            and perhaps the <span class="date-1829-08">August 1829</span> issue was missing even by the <span class="date-1840-1849">1840s</span>, 
                            when <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> compiled his faulty list in <a href="../apparatuses/msiv_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSIV">MS IV</span></a>; 
                            see below, <a href="#REDISCOVERY">The Rediscovery of Ruskin&#x02BC;s First Publication</a>.) Thus, lacking copytext from a published source, 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> appears to have ignored or forgotten <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s entry in

                            Apparently, by <span class="date-1891">1891</span>, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> had not seen the booklet,

                            By <span class="date-1893">1893</span>, however, he had made up for this oversight, describing both the poem and the <span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Waterloo&#x201D;</span> booklet in

               </p>
               
               <p>It is a coincidence that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> decided, like the <span class="persName-EA">Reverend Andrews</span>, to divide 
                            <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original poem into two, separately titled parts, although he did not divide the poem the same way. 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> probably got the idea to divide the poem from an accidental feature of the 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a> draft: 
                            the section that he separated out and entitled <span class="title-poem-JRSKIDDAW1891">&#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D;</span> happens to precede the prose fragment, 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/sermon_notes_christs_intercession_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-sermon-JRSERMONNOTESCHRISTS">Sermon Notes &#x005B;&#x201C;christs intercession&#x201C;&#x005D;</span></a>, 
                            which interrupts the sequential composition of the poem; 
                            and the section that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> entitled <span class="title-poem-JRDERWENTWATER1891">&#x201C;Derwentwater&#x201D;</span> 
                            follows the prose fragment, with the resumption of composition declared by a short form of the poem&#x02BC;s title, &#x201C;skiddaw derwent water.&#x201D; 
                            In this segmenting of the draft, there is no indication that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended separate poems, although the interruption 
                            the prose fragment does occur at a clear point of transition, signaled by the line, &#x201C;Now derwent water come a looking glass&#x201D;.
               </p>
               
               <p>With the recovery of <a href="../apparatuses/battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His Father&#x201D;</span></a>, 
                            which was apparently unavailable to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> when editing <span class="title-book-JRPOEMS1891"><i>Poems</i> (1891)</span>, 
                            the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> were able to publish <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                            fair&#x2010;copy version, <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATERMSV">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span>. 
                            As copytext for the main reading version of the poem, however, the editors, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>, 
                            adopted the <span class="date-1830-02">February 1830</span> <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> version, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent&#x2010;Water&#x201D;</span>, presumably having followed up on the evidence 
                            that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> provided and yet himself neglected from <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s

                            The editors did not print <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland&#x201D;</span> 
                            from the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, showing like <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> 
                            no awareness of the existence of that earlier publication. The editors also printed the complete text of the fair&#x2010;copy version from the 
                            <span class="title-manuscript-BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">&#x201C;Waterloo&#x201D;</span> booklet, but they dropped this text into a note; moreover, they annotated 
                            this text of the fair&#x2010;copy version with a comparison to <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s versions, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRSKIDDAW1891">&#x201C;Skiddaw&#x201D;</span> and <span class="title-poem-JRDERWENTWATER1891">&#x201C;Derwentwater&#x201D;</span>. 
                            The editors remark that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> based his versions on &#x201C;the somewhat illegible draft&#x201D; in 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>, but, when noting variants, the editors 
                            fail to make clear to the reader that the variants included some of the numerous omissions and editorial interventions introduced by <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> 
                            and not necessarily true variants between the draft and fair&#x2010;copy texts (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:265&#x2013;68).
               </p>
               
               <p>Thus, while <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> brought the publishing history of 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span> partially into view for the first time since <span class="date-1830">1830</span>, 
                            they added confusion to the compositional history, even as they presented new materials for that history. In addition to their conflation of the texts of 
                            <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s versions and of the <span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span> version, 
                            as if they were discussing the same text, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> 
                            introduced numerous silent editorial changes of their own into their texts of the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> version, 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent&#x2010;Water&#x201D;</span>, and of the

               </p>
               
               <p>As a final contribution to these representations of textual history, <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> saw fit to cobble together yet another version, 
                            using copytext from both the <span class="date-1830-02">February 1830</span> <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> version, 
                            and <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s editing of the draft version (, 23).

                            publications, their first known mention occurs when, sometime in the <span class="date-1840-1849">1840s</span>, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>

                            <span class="persName-HRN">H. Robertson Nicoll</span> (1851&#x2013;1923), who in <span class="date-1895-06">June 1895</span> published an article, 
                            <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#NICOLLFIRSTPUBLISHEDWRITINGS" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;First Published Writings of Mr. Ruskin&#x201D;</a>, 
                            in a journal that he founded and edited, the <span class="title-periodical-BOOKMAN"><i>Bookman</i></span>. 
                            Yet no mention of this discovery was made by the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, who, seven years later, 
                            printed from (altered) copytext of the second of the two poems, <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent&#x2010;Water&#x201D;</span>, 
                            heralding this recovery as &#x201C;the earliest printed work of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x201D; 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:265). 
                            Thus, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> perpetuated the seemingly fatalistic neglect of the 
                            <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines&#x201D;</span>, which awaited a second rediscovery by <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span>, 
                            who corrected the record in a <span class="date-1994">1994</span> note,<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RUSKINFIRSTPUB" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;John Ruskin&#x02BC;s First Published Work&#x201D;</a>. 
                            Publishing his note almost exactly a century following the appearance of <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s article, 
                            <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span>, like <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span>, 
                            failed to record the <span class="date-1895">1895</span> recovery&#x2014;in his case, clearly unaware of the prior discovery.
               </p>
               
               <p>Presumably, in re&#x2010;publishing at least the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> poem, <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> 
                            were following up <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s neglected citation in his <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</span>. 
                            They do not credit <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s article anywhere in the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span>, 
                            despite quoting from another article by him on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> that was published in the same journal 
                            (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 38:381).  
                            <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-AW">Wedderburn</span> must have obtained the <span class="date-1830">1830</span> 
                  <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> text independently. Their bibliographical note on the poem 
                            (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:265 n.1) contains details about the 
                            <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> that are lacking in 
                            <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s article, and vice versa. On <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s part, it seems equally and oddly coincidental&#x2014;or 
                            culpably neglectful&#x2014;that he fails cite <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="title-bibliography_text-COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D;</span>, 
                            since it seems scarcely credible that he could have been led to the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> 
                            apart from <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s quotation from <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s citation, however faulty in mistranscription. 
                            <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> implies, however, that he found the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> 
                            by following his own clue&#x2014;namely, the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s connections with <span class="persName-EA">Edward Andrews</span>: 
                            &#x201C;I have before me a volume containing ten numbers, all that were published, of the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>. . . . 
                            The editor was the <span class="persName-EA">Rev. Dr. Andrews</span>, minister of <span class="title-architecture-BERESFORDCHAPEL">Beresford Chapel</span>, 
                            <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span>, one of the most distinguished dissenting ministers of his time. . . . The distinction 
                            of the periodical is that it contains the first published writings of Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, 
                            it will be remembered &#x005B;from <span class="title-book-PRAETERITA">Praeterita</span>&#x005D;, was at one time a pupil of <span class="persName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span>, 
                            and was occasionally present in his chapel, where he remembers seeing <span class="persName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s daughter &#x005B;<span class="persName-EAP">Emily Augusta Andrews</span>, 1824&#x2013;62&#x005D;,

               </p>
               
               <p>The cul de sac of <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s scholarship is striking in view of the phenomenon of the 
                            <a href="../notes/collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php" target="_blank">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>, 
                            which prompted keen rivalries for obtaining &#x201C;early editions&#x201D; of modern authors at high prices on the rare book market. Two circumstances may have blunted 
                            <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s coup from causing its due sensation. First, two years earlier, in <span class="date-1893">1893</span>, 
                            <span class="persName-JPS">James P. Smart</span> and <span class="persName-TJW">Thomas J. Wise</span> had already completed their 
                            <a href="../notes/bibliography_of_ruskin_wise_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Complete Bibliography of . . . Ruskin</i> (1889&#x2013;93)</a>, 
                            which supported <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s contention that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first publication 
                            was <span class="date-1834-03">March 1834</span> prose piece for the <span class="title-periodical-MAGAZINEOFNATURALHISTORY">Magazine of Natural History</span>, the 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/enquiries_on_the_causes_of_the_colour_of_the_water_of_the_rhine_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-essay-JRENQUIRIES">&#x201C;Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water of the Rhine&#x201D;</span></a>; 
                            and the bibliography identified <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first published <i>poem</i> as 
                            <a href="../apparatuses/saltzburg_apparatus.php" target="_blank">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</a> in <span class="title-anthology-FRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><i>Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</i></span>

                            Second, <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s correction to the bibliography perhaps never gained traction owing to the excessive rarity of the 
                            <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>. Probably, no copy ever appeared on the rare book market. 
                            To document his find, <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span> had to seek help from the Andrews family: &#x201C;Through the kindness of 
                            <span class="persName-EA">Dr. Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s granddaughter, &#x005B;the lawyer and social activist&#x005D; Miss <span class="persName-EO">Eliza Orme</span> &#x005B;1848&#x2013;1937&#x005D;, 
                            I have been able to identify Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s contributions&#x201D;

                            Curiously, when <span class="persName-JSD">James S. Dearden</span> repeated <span class="persName-HRN">Nicoll</span>&#x02BC;s discovery a century later, 
                            he repeated history by in a sense relying on the Andrews family: his research was prompted by a bound copy of the 
                            <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> that had originally belonged to the 
                            <span class="persName-EA">Reverend Andrews&#x003E;</span> himself, &#x201C;one of the rarest pieces of Ruskiniana,&#x201D; <span class="persName-JSD">Dearden</span> 
                            comments, and one of the last additions to the <span class="orgName-RUSKINGALLERIES">Ruskin Galleries</span> at <span class="orgName-BEMBRIDGESCHOOL">Bembridge</span>

            <p>In <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span>, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        made his most ambitious effort to date to engage with the conventions of the picturesque, which first appears in the juvenilia of <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, 
                        when he gathered poems into a small anthology that he entitled 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;Poetry Discriptive&#x201D;</span></a>. 
                        That he was consciously writing the present poem in the same mode is implicit in his original title, 
                        <span class="title-poem-RUSKINSKIDDAWANDDERWENT">&#x201C;description of skiddaw &#x0026; lake derwent&#x201D;</span>. 
                        It is less clear, however, whether he derived materials for the poem from the picturesque journeying. The poems in 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-anthology-POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;Poetry Discriptive&#x201D;</span></a> 
                        originated from a family tour in <span class="date-1827">1827</span> to <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span>, 
                        whereas the editors of the <span class="title-book-JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</span> believed that 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span> &#x201C;must have been based on memories of the visit 
                        to the <span class="placeName-">Lakes</span> in <span class="date-1826">1826</span> 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:265 n. 1; 
                        and see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 1:xxv, and 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#TOURLAKESINTRO" target="_blank" class="inactive">Burd, &#x201C;Introduction&#x201D; to <i>Tour to the Lakes in Cumberland</i></a>, 6&#x2013;7, 
                        for possible earlier journeys to the <span class="placeName-">Lake District</span>). Evidence of such an <span class="date-1826">1826</span> visit is elusive. 
                        Arguments for dating and mapping the early family journeys have tended to work in circles, with <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s dateable poems 
                        about locales cited as evidence for the journeys that are used to contextualize those very poems. In the present instance, as argued in 
                        <a href="../notes/tours_of_1826-27_note.php" target="_blank">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</a>, while the <span class="placeName-">Lakes</span> 
                        was a possible destination in both <span class="date-1826">1826</span> and <span class="date-1827">1827</span>, no direct evidence attests to a visit. 
                        (As also argued, it is possible that an alleged <span class="date-1826">1826</span> northern journey might not have occurred at all, but may be a mistaken reference 
                        to an <span class="date-1827">1827</span> journey that included <span class="placeName-WALES">Wales</span> and <span class="placeName-SCOTLAND">Scotland</span> 
                        but not necessarily the <span class="placeName-">Lake District</span>.)
            </p>
            
            <p>Biographically, perhaps the most significant influence on <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem was a journey that definitely 
                        failed to materialize. In <span class="date-1828">1828</span>, the family embarked on a <a href="../notes/tour_of_1828_note.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;great tour&#x201D;</a> 
                        destined for the <span class="placeName-">Lakes</span>, but they cut the trip short when they had gotten only so far as <span class="placeName-CORNWALL">Cornwall</span>, 
                        owing to the death of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s sister, 
                        <a href="../notes/richardson_jessie_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-JRP">Jessie</span> (1783&#x2013;1828)</a>. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> 
                        may have been moved to write about these scenes for <span class="persName-JJR">his father</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1829">1829</span> birthday 
                        as a compensation for the lost tour, and as an anticipation of the grand tour to come, the <span class="placeName-">Lake District</span> 
               <a href="../notes/tour_of_1830_note" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1830</a>, which the family was probably already planning in <span class="date-1829">1829</span>. 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span> is a distinctly joyous poem, 
                        but its point was to dispel memories of grief rather than to record them. (For another topographical poem that may have been connected therapeutically with grief, see 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/on_scotland_apparatus.php" target="_blank"><span class="title-poem-ONSCOTLAND">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</span></a>.)
            </p>
            
            <p>In light of the association of <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</span> with the aborted 
                        <a href="../notes/tour_of_1828_note.xml" target="_blank" class="inactive">Tour of 1828</a> owing to the death of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        <span class="persName-JRP">Aunt Jessie</span>, the poem&#x02BC;s publication in a religious journal, the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, 
                        owned and edited by the <span class="persName-EA">Reverend Andrews</span>, is understandable. Not that a secular poem was wholly out of place in <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        periodical, which was only one among several testimonials of the Andrews family&#x02BC;s cultivated tastes and social ambition, such as the fine organ installed in 
                        <span class="placeName-BERESFORDCHAPEL"></span>, a building that <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> also owned (see

                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> did not write the poem for the clergyman, of course, but its composition was contemporaneous with the advent of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s

                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200); and the teaching was delightfully entertaining. As

            <p>As both proprietor and editor of the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> 
                        could do as he liked, including publish writing by his own children&#x2014;so why not include verse by his merry and precocious new student, as well? 
                        (Reciprocally, <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span> would later copy verses entitled <span class="title-poem-ANDREWSELIZABRAVEHUSSAR">&#x201C;The Brave Hussar&#x201D;</span>

                        However, the writing for the journal by <span class="persName-EASON">Andrew&#x02BC;s eldest son, Edward</span>, while not solemn, was religious

                        and it was appropriate, accordingly, that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s contributions likewise be given a sober coloring, with the addition of conventional pieties 
                        (see <a href="#PUBLICATION">Revision and First Publication</a>). In the couplets added to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem 
                        that avert the gaze from earth&#x02BC;s beauties, the poem was made consistent with a work by another juvenile writer, <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANONLINESBYAYOUTH" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x201C;Lines by a Youth &#x007C; Not Alone&#x201D;</a>,

            <p>Thus, in wrapping <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s playful topographical poem in a casing, as it were, of conventionally otherworldly piety, the revised 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRLINESCUMBERLAND1829">&#x201C;Lines Written at the Lakes in Cumberland. &#x007C; <i>Derwentwater</i>&#x201D;</span> and 
                        <span class="title-poem-JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER1830">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent&#x2010;Water&#x201D;</span>, as published 
                        in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>, only called to mind what a closely knit circle of suburban evangelical 
                        households already knew about the deep mourning that had thwarted the Ruskins&#x02BC; anticipated picturesque pleasures of <span class="geogName-SKIDDAW"> Mount Skiddaw</span> 
                        and <span class="geogName-DERWENT">Derwent Water</span>&#x2014;a mournfulness that should not be lost even in the anticipation of recouping that pleasure. 
                        This understanding nonetheless did not lighten <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s struggle with revising the poem.
            </p>
            
            <p>What was the status of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s short&#x2010;lived <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>? 
                        In its first issue, the journal announced itself as a &#x201C;sprightly and elegant&#x201D; production that would &#x201C;break out of the trammels in which other religious 
                        periodicals seem proud to confine themselves, and show that even piety may be connected with high talent, and that vulgarity of style is not inseparable 
                        with what are foolishly called high doctrines, and dulness from what more sober persons call Evangelical&#x201D; (quoted in 
                        <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#NICOLLFIRSTPUBLISHEDWRITINGS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Nicoll, &#x201C;First Published Writings of Mr. <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x201D;</a>). 
                        The tone matches what <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> remarked as <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s signature &#x201C;expressions&#x201D; of 
                        &#x201C;almost but not quite&#x201D; and of appearing &#x201C;best when he frowns next when he laughs and next when he neither frowns nor laughs.&#x201D; 
                        The characterization suggests the phenomenon of miscellaneity that <span class="persName-DSCRITIC">David Stewart</span> has remarked in the 
                        <span class="placeName-LONDON">London</span> magazine culture of the <span class="date-1820-1829">1820s</span>, 
                        as a conviction of knowledge as &#x201C;contained within a single intellectual structure&#x201D; was relinquished for an idea of knowledge as 
                        &#x201C;divided between a large number of distinct divisions&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STEWARTROMANTICMAGAZINES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Stewart, <i>Romantic Magazines and Metropolitan Literary Culture</i></a>, 5). 
                        It is possible that <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> intended the handmade pamphlet, <a href="../apparatuses/msii_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-manuscript-MSII">MS II</span></a>, 
                        to reflect this eclectic magazine culture, combining, as it does, poems and sermons, an Edgeworthian lesson and a religious piece entitled "a theme", a start on a play, 
                        and letters to family and friends as if corresponding with a subscribership.
            </p>
            
            <p>In avoiding the pitfalls of sectarianism and the reputaton of Nonconformists for stiff&#x2010;necked resistence to the worldliness of learning and cultivation, 
                        the journal&#x02BC;s mission appears comparable to that of the more successful Congregational magazine, the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic Review</i></span> 
                        (1805&#x2013;68), which likewise stood for a broad cultivation of literature combined with evangelical seriousness. In the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span>&#x02BC;s 
                        first years, regular contributors included the essayist, <span class="persName-JFOSTER">John Foster</span> (1770&#x2013;1843), and the poet, 
                        <span class="persName-JMPOET">James Montgomery</span> (1771&#x2013;1854). Theologically and politically, the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span> 
                        sought to bridge the gap between Dissent and Establishment&#x2014;an &#x201C;eclectic&#x201D; stance that the journal itself proved unable to maintain, 
                        driven eventually to promoting more decisively Nonconformist interests of civic and religious liberty 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HILLERECLECTICREVIEW" target="_blank" class="inactive">Hiller, &#x201C;<i>Eclectic Review</i>&#x201D;</a>, 179&#x2013;86). 
                        <span class="persName-DSCRITIC">David Stewart</span> proposes that Romantic magazines, rather than becoming trapped in bunkered positions as culture fissured into 
                        competing disciplines and positions, sought a heterogeneous audience who in turn positioned itself in relation to a magazine culture and not just a single organ of opinion 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#STEWARTROMANTICMAGAZINES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Stewart, <i>Romantic Magazines and Metropolitan Literary Culture</i></a>, 7&#x2013;8). 
                        The growing predicament of the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span> illustrates how precarious an 
                        &#x201C;almost but not quite&#x201D; demeanor could prove in the turbulent period of reform. The <span class="title-periodical-PATRIOT"><i>Patriot</i></span> (1832&#x2013;66), 
                        another heterogeneous periodical operated jointly by interests of <span class="orgName-CONGREGATIONALISM">Congregationalists</span> and <span class="orgName-BAPTISM">Baptists</span>, 
                        struggled to build adequate support on a nationwide subscriber base of Dissenters who upheld loyalty to voluntaryism on the question of Church Establishment, 
                        but who shrank from identifying with radical Dissent. The newspaper&#x02BC;s trustees turned to the experienced journalist, <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Josiah Conder</span> (1789&#x2013;1855), 
                        already editor of the <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic Review</i></span>, to increase subscription, 
                        but the <span class="title-periodical-PATRIOT"><i>Patriot</i></span> nonetheless almost foundered along with its editor 
                        because <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span> was perceived as too soft on the question of Establishment even in the view of moderates, 
                        must less of the radical voluntaryists (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#COOPERPATRIOT" target="_blank" class="inactive">Cooper, &#x201C;Dissenters and National Journalism&#x201D;</a>). 
                        Given that the weekly <span class="title-periodical-PATRIOT"><i>Patriot</i></span> and monthly <span class="title-periodical-ECLECTICREVIEW"><i>Eclectic</i></span> 
                        survived only by virtue of deft political and theological positioning, not to mention the hugely energetic labors of professional journalists like <span class="persName-JCEDITOR">Conder</span>, 
                        no wonder that the modest <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> failed to summon adequate support. Add to this 
                        the scale of the competition, with four thousand journal titles estimated to have been founded in <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> 
               <span class="date-1790-1832">between 1790 and 1832</span>, and <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> was soon forced to shut down the costly venture 
                        within the first year of his magazine&#x02BC;s publication 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Anstruther, <i>Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</i></a>, 16;

            </p>
            
            <p>The ephemerality of <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>&#x02BC;s journal may account for the relative unimportance that the Ruskins appear to have attached to 
                        <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s first publication. Yet, while the Ruskins would seek loftier venues for <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s 
                        subsequent boyhood publications, a feature of this first effort persisted in the family&#x02BC;s tendency to gravitate to publishers with whom they could establish 
                        a personal connection such as a shared Scottish heritage. In about four years, <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s two poems in the 
                        <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span> would be almost forgotten, dimmed by the splendor surrounding the appearance of his poems,

                        and the contribution of his prose piece, <a href="../apparatuses/enquiries_on_the_causes_of_the_colour_of_the_water_of_the_rhine_apparatus.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="title-essay-JRENQUIRIES">&#x201C;Enquiries on the Causes of the Colour of the Water of the Rhine&#x201D;</span></a>,

                        Nonetheless, leading up to these publications, the Ruskins sought the mentorship of men of letters who, while more celebrated than <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, 
                        had like him visited the Ruskins&#x02BC; suburban home, <span class="placeName-HERNE">Herne Hill</span>&#x2014;the poet and editor, 
                        <a href="../notes/pringle_thomas_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-TP">Thomas Pringle</span> (1789&#x2013;1834)</a>; the author, 
                        <a href="../notes/hogg_james_note.php" target="_blank"><span class="persName-JH">James Hogg</span> (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</a>; and the publisher, 
                        <span class="persName-AE">Alexander Elder</span> (1790&#x2013;1876). All were Scotsmen; and <span class="persName-AE">Elder</span>&#x02BC;s publishing firm, 
                        <span class="orgName-SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</span>, even employed <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s cousin, 
                        <a href="../notes/richardson_charles_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive">Charles Thomas Richardson (1811&#x2013;34)</a>, as a shop boy. These professional yet 
                        also personal acquaintances would help to shape the literary persona known as <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</span>, which had already gotten his start as 
                        <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;R.&#x201D;</span> in the <span class="title-periodical-SPIRITUALTIMES"><i>Spiritual Times</i></span>.
            </p>
            
            <p>In <span class="date-1829">1829</span>, not only could the Ruskins claim personal connections with <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span>, but the 
                        <span class="placeName-WALWORTH">Walworth</span> preacher could impress them with his own share of fame. He was a rising star in the metropolitan pulpit, 
                        an eloquent and popular clergyman whose dashing appearance commanded no fewer than a dozen painted, engraved, and sculpted portraits in his lifetime 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#ANSTRUTHERCOVENTRYPATMORESANGEL" target="_blank" class="inactive">Anstruther, <i>Coventry Patmore&#x02BC;s Angel</i></a>, 123&#x2013;24). 
                        &#x201C;What a nice face he has,&#x201C; commented the young <span class="persName-JR">John Ruskin</span>. Yet, unlike the distinguished Scotsmen who ushered 
                        <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</span> into the limelight in <span class="date-1834-1835">1834&#x2013;35</span>, 
                        <span class="persName-EA">Andrews</span> fell from grace. Perhaps the main discouragement to giving <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s first 
                        publication its full due was the pronouncement by the elder Ruskins in <span class="date-1831">1831</span> that, while &#x201C;the Dr. has wonderful talents . . . 
                        he is certainly fighty&#x201D; and on his way to compromising &#x201C;his respectability and fortune and prevent&#x005B;ing&#x005D; his filling that place in society his talents entitle him to&#x201D; 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFL" target="_blank" class="inactive"><i>Ruskin Family Letters</i></a>, 200, 243; and see

                        It must have seemed intolerable that the literary birth of <span class="persName-pen_name-JR">&#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;</span> could have been attended by anything less than 
                        the most solid assurances of success, much less the want of respectability.
