                    editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> felt justified in naming this section of prose and verse 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title> without enclosing the title in square brackets, 
                    to indicate their responsibility for the title. 
                    Their reasoning, presumably, was that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> had already published the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title> 
                    in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>)</title>, 
                    with the poem's title as found in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>; and the prose essay drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>,

                    although untitled, surely must have been intended to be associated with that poem, since its related topic is announced in the first sentence.</p>
                    
                    <p>That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended a composite section centered on the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> appears likely; in fact, according to the

                        he intended more than one&#x2014;the sections named

                        which (if either) of these two section titles were meant to contain (either or both) the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> and the essay in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        and indeed whether the poem and essay belong together in the same section at all. Of the two sections in the list named for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName></title>, the first, 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINEFALLS">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, 
                        is centered in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, falling among a group of titles associated with the sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>, 
                        prior to the family's crossing into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> (see the contextual glosses for

                        The second of the two <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName></title> titles in the list, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, is centered in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, 
                        falling between the proposed sections <title type="composite" corresp="#JRBASLECOMP"><placeName corresp="#BASLE">&#x201C;Basle&#x201D;</placeName></title> and

                        The respective contents of the poem and essay about the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> suggest that they should not be joined in the same composite section, but that the prose essay was meant for the German group, 
                        and the poem for the Swiss group. This division is consistent with the manuscript contexts in which the pieces respectively appear&#x2014;the essay about the German <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> 
                        consistent with most of the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, which concerns northern Europe and crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>; and the poem about the Swiss Rhine a complement to the only other

                    The Ruskins did not visit the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Harz</geogName> in <date when="1833">1833</date>. In his <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName> adopts a tone of British superiority toward this district, if not toward the people 
                    as does <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in this essay: &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">The Brocken</geogName>, the loftiest summit, is lower than the highest British mountains, but the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Hartz</geogName> chain rises alone immediately out of a level plain 
                    extending all the way to the <geogName corresp="#THEBALTIC">Baltic</geogName>, whose inhabitants, accustomed to an uninterrupted flat, exaggerate both the elevation and the beauties of the only range of hills 
                    that fall within their observation. Their scenery would probably appear tame, and their height inconsiderable to one accustomed to the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, in comparison with which the Hartz is a mere molehill&#x201D;. 
                    Also like <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, he notes that the &#x201C;district may indeed be considered the cradle of innumerable superstitions, some of them even now not extinct, of Gnomes and Cobolds, 
                    witches, and the headless horseman. Several odd-shaped masses of granite around the summit of the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> are named after the witches; for example, the <geogName corresp="#TEUFELSKANZEL">Devil's Pulpit</geogName> . . . ; 
                    the <geogName corresp="#HEXENALTAR">Witches' Altar</geogName>; and not far off, the Witches' Lake. According to the well-known legend, the witches hold their Sabbath on this spot once a-year, 
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">eve</hi> of May-day, called in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> <hi rend="italic">Walpurgis nacht</hi> from the name of a saint who converted the Saxons

                    In contrast, <persName corresp="#FMT">Frances Trollope</persName> and her family, traveling in the same year as the Ruskins' tour, were deeply impressed by the forest scenery as they scaled the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName>

                    "that <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> had at this time formed some idea of the fairy story, with a German setting, which afterwards became 
                    <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">The King of the Golden River</hi></title>, or the allusion may be to

                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:368 n. 1). The latter suggestion is not far-fetched, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed

                        likely inspired by <title type="book" corresp="#BULWERLYTTONPILGRIMS"><hi rend="italic">Pilgrims of the Rhine</hi></title> 
                        (<date when="1834">1834</date>) by <persName corresp="#EBL">Edward Bulwer-Lytton</persName>, in which English fairies accompany a human couple on a tour of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sets his tale in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, 
                        where the sprites hold a council, complaining of neglect and disbelief and therefore proposing to emigrate to <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> where legends of supernatural creatures are credited. 
                        (<persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>'s guidebook account of the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> mentions the belief that, on Walpurgisnacht on the mountaintop, "all the evil spirits in the world assemble to offer allegiance to their unmentionable master"

                        As an English story in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s telling, the inset tale is consistent with the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> setting for the story of <persName corresp="#CG">Gough</persName> and his faithful dog, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imports into

                        who uses digressive tales to vary the symmetrical structures and forward geographical sequence of <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. 
                        Unlike <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, whose tales are indigenous to the places where they occur in his tour poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prefers English stories, whether from familiarity or British pride or both.</p>
