                    editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> felt justified in naming this section of prose and verse 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title> without enclosing the title in square brackets, 
                    to indicate their responsibility for the title. 
                    Their reasoning, presumably, was that <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> had already published the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title>

                    <p>That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended a composite section centered on the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> appears likely; in fact, according to the

                        he intended more than one&#x2014;the sections named

                        which (if either) of these two section titles were meant to contain (either or both) the poem in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> and the essay in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, 
                        and indeed whether the poem and essay belong together in the same section at all. Of the two sections in the list named for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName></title>, the first, 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINEFALLS">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, 
                        is centered in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, falling among a group of titles associated with the sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>,

                        The second of the two <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName></title> titles in the list, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, is centered in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, 
                        falling between the proposed sections <title type="composite" corresp="#JRBASLECOMP"><placeName corresp="#BASLE">&#x201C;Basle&#x201D;</placeName></title> and

                        The respective contents of the poem and essay about the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> suggest that they should not be joined in the same composite section, but that the prose essay was meant for the German group, 
                        and the poem for the Swiss group. This division is consistent with the manuscript contexts in which the pieces respectively appear&#x2014;the essay about the German <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> 
                        consistent with most of the draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, which concerns northern Europe and crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> into <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>; and the poem about the Swiss Rhine a complement to the only other

                    The Ruskins did not visit the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Harz</geogName> in <date when="1833">1833</date>. In his <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName> adopts a tone of British superiority toward this district, if not toward the people 
                    as does <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in this essay: &#x201C;<geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">The Brocken</geogName>, the loftiest summit, is lower than the highest British mountains, but the <geogName corresp="#HARZ">Hartz</geogName> chain rises alone immediately out of a level plain 
                    extending all the way to the <geogName corresp="#THEBALTIC">Baltic</geogName>, whose inhabitants, accustomed to an uninterrupted flat, exaggerate both the elevation and the beauties of the only range of hills 
                    that fall within their observation. Their scenery would probably appear tame, and their height inconsiderable to one accustomed to the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, in comparison with which the Hartz is a mere molehill&#x201D;. 
                    Also like <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, he notes that the &#x201C;district may indeed be considered the cradle of innumerable superstitions, some of them even now not extinct, of Gnomes and Cobolds, 
                    witches, and the headless horseman. Several odd-shaped masses of granite around the summit of the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> are named after the witches; for example, the <geogName corresp="#TEUFELSKANZEL">Devil's Pulpit</geogName> . . . ; 
                    the <geogName corresp="#HEXENALTAR">Witches' Altar</geogName>; and not far off, the Witches' Lake. According to the well-known legend, the witches hold their Sabbath on this spot once a-year, 
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">eve</hi> of May-day, called in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> <hi rend="italic">Walpurgis nacht</hi> from the name of a saint who converted the Saxons

                    In contrast, <persName corresp="#FMT">Frances Trollope</persName> and her family, traveling in the same year as the Ruskins' tour, were deeply impressed by the forest scenery as they scaled the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> 
                    on mules, allowing their imagination to be colored by the romance of <persName corresp="#JWG">Goethe</persName>'s <title type="poem" corresp="#GOETHEFAUST"><hi rend="italic">Faust</hi></title> and

                    Originally one of the many "robber-nests" where the lord exacted duties from merchants passing on the river, in recent history the fortress had been surrendered in 1794 
                    to the French Revolutionary Army and, a few years later, blown up

                    Ruskin refers to its "vaulted chambers" perhaps because the Renaissance portion of the castle included a vast vaulted cellar. In her travel diary, 
                    <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> lists Rheinfels among several sites passed en route at the end of May 1833, but she does not suggest that they stopped

                        (<date when="1834">1834</date>) by <persName corresp="#EBL">Edward Bulwer-Lytton</persName>, in which English fairies accompany a human couple on a tour of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sets his tale in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, 
                        where the sprites hold a council, complaining of neglect and disbelief and therefore proposing to emigrate to <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> where legends of supernatural creatures are credited. 
                        (<persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>'s guidebook account of the <geogName corresp="#BROCKEN">Brocken</geogName> mentions the belief that, on Walpurgisnacht on the mountaintop, "all the evil spirits in the world assemble to offer allegiance to their unmentionable master"

                        As an English story in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s telling, the inset tale is consistent with the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> setting for the story of <persName corresp="#CG">Gough</persName> and his faithful dog, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imports into

                        Unlike <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, whose tales are indigenous to the places where they occur in his tour poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prefers English stories, whether from familiarity or British pride or both.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the idea for <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> may have originated with the framing introduction 
                        of a narrator that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> sets up at the end of the essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRTRADITIONSOFTHERHINE">&#x201C;The traditions of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> have long been celebrated&#x201D; [<geogName corresp="#RHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</geogName>]</title>, 
                        by the time of composing the narrative poem <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had probably abandoned any serious intention of uniting it with the essay in the unfinished fair-copy of the 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. He had moved on, just as <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> 
                        advances beyond the octosyllabic couplets that predominate throughout the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>, 
                        to experiment with a twelve-line stanza. The stanza continues to rely on octosyllabic lines, but consists of a quartet, sestet, and couplet, built from a more ambitious rhyme scheme 
                        (abba cdcdcd ee)--an improvisation, perhaps, on a stanza type in <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName> or <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>. Rather than planning the poem for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps destined it for the annuals--the public ambition that had swerved his attention from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title> in the first place,

                    see <ref type="witness" target="cologne_prose_msix.php">"Cologne" [essay]</ref> (and glosses), where this name is associated with the far reaches of the source of the Rhine. 
                    The <geogName corresp="#DINARICALPS">Dinaric Alps</geogName> skirt the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. If not merely a mistaken usage of the term (see the textual gloss for line 10 of the poem), 
                    Ruskin appears to use the name of the Dinaric Alps similarly to his evocation of the Rhaetian Alps, to evoke distant boundaries 
                    of the imagination. Respecting knowledge of the Rh&#x00E6;tian Alps, however, Ruskin drew on the actual experience of following tributaries of the Rhine into those mountains, 
                    whereas the Dinaric Alps lay beyond his ken. Even usage of the name appears to have been unusual in English at this timne. 
                    The earliest usage of the adjective cited in the <title type="dictionary" corresp="#OED"><hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi></title> is from 1833 in the 
                    <title type="dictionary" corresp="#PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA"><hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclop&#x00E6;dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</hi></title>, 
                    which has this to say about the terrain of Bosnia: 
                    "Bosnia is a mountainous country and contains deep valleys. . . . The mountains are branches of the Dinaric and Julian Alps, which enter it on the side of Austria. . . . 
                    The lower regions of the Dinaric range are in many parts entirely naked, those immediately above them are covered with pines and rich pastures, 
                    and the uppermost consist of rocks thinly interspersed with wild rosemary, thyme, and other low plants" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA"><title type="dictionary" corresp="#PENNYCYCLOPAEDIA"><hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclop&#x00E6;dia</hi></title></ref>, 5:230 [1836], and see 1:387 [1833]). 
                    This region formed part of what at the time was called Turkey in Europe, the western boundary of the Ottoman Empire. 
                    According to Ruskin's boyhood geography book, Turkey in Europe was a barbarous place, "once the seat of civilization, learning, and the arts, 
                    includ[ing] ancient Greece and other countries, formerly the finest in the world, but, owing to the Mahometan religion, to the despotism of the government, 
                    and to the ignorant policy of the Turks, now the most desolate and miserable"
