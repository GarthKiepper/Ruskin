                    editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> felt justified in naming this section of prose and verse 
                    <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title> without enclosing the title in square brackets, 
                    to indicate their responsibility for the title. 
                    Their reasoning, presumably, was that W. G. Collingwood had already published the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHERHINE">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title> 
                    in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</title>, 
                    with the poem's title as found in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>; and the prose essay drafted in MS VIII, 
                    <title type="essay" corresp="#JRTRADITIONSOFTHERHINE">&#x201C;The traditions of the Rhine have long been celebrated&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;]</title>, 
                    although untitled, surely must have been intended to be associated with that poem, since its related topic is announced in the first sentence.</p>
                    
                    <p>That Ruskin intended a composite section centered on the Rhine River appears likely; in fact, according to the 
                        <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii_contents.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">List of Proposed Additional Contents for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        he intended more than one&#x2014;the sections named 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINEFALLS">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title> and

                        which (if either) of these two section titles were meant to contain (either or both) the poem in MS VII and the essay in MS VIII, 
                        and indeed whether the poem and essay belong together in the same section at all. Of the two sections in the list named for the Rhine, the first, 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRFALLOFTHERHINECOMP"><geogName corresp="#RHINEFALLS">&#x201C;The Fall of the Rhine&#x201D;</geogName></title>, 
                        is centered in Germany, falling among a group of titles associated with the sighting of the Alps from Schaffhausen, 
                        prior to the family's crossing into Italy (see the contextual glosses for 
                        <ref type="witness" target="there_is_a_charmed_peace_that_aye_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace that aye&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;]</title></ref>, 
                        as well as the contextual glosses for

                        The second of the two Rhine titles in the list, <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHERHINECOMP">&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;</title>, is centered in Switzerland, 
                        falling between the proposed sections <title type="composite" corresp="#JRBASLECOMP">&#x201C;Basle&#x201D;</title> and 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRBALSTALLCOMP">&#x201C;Balstall&#x201D;</title> (see the figure, <ref type="figure" target="balstall_drawing_msix.php"><title type="artwork" corresp="#JRBALSTALLMSIX">Balstall Drawing</title></ref>, 
                        in MS IX, the sole piece of these sections to be created or survive). 
                        The respective contents of the poem and essay about the Rhine suggest that they should not be joined in the same composite section, but that the prose essay was meant for the German group, 
                        and the poem for the Swiss group. This division is consistent with the manuscript contexts in which the pieces respectively appear&#x2014;the essay about the German Rhine 
                        consistent with most of the draft in MS VIII, which concerns northern Europe and crossing the Alps into Italy; and the poem about the Swiss Rhine a complement to the only other 
                        piece in MS VII related to the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title>, 
                        a poem about the Swiss valley, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCHAMOUNI">"Chamouni"</title>.</p></note><!--The pointer to this gloss would be <ref type="gloss" target="the_rhine_glosses_contextual.php#THERHINETITLE"/>.-->

                    The Ruskins did not visit the Harz in 1833. In his 1836 guidebook, John Murray III adopts a tone of British superiority toward this district, if not toward the people 
                    as does Ruskin in this essay: "The Brocken, the loftiest summit, is lower than the highest British mountains, but the Hartz chain rises alone immediately out of a level plain 
                    extending all the way to the Baltic, whose inhabitants, accustomed to an uninterrupted flat, exaggerate both the elevation and the beauties of the only range of hills 
                    that fall within their observation. Their scenery would probably appear tame, and their height inconsiderable to one accustomed to the Alps, in comparison with which the Hartz is a mere molehill". 
                    Also like Ruskin, he notes that the "district may indeed be considered the cradle of innumerable superstitions, some of them even now not extinct, of Gnomes and Cobolds, 
                    witches, and the headless horseman. Several odd-shaped masses of granite around the summit of the Brocken are named after the witches; for example, the Devil's Pulpit . . . ; 
                    the Witches' Altar; and not far off, the Witches' Lake. According to the well-known legend, the witches hold their Sabbath on this spot once a-year, 
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">eve</hi> of May-day, called in Germany <hi rend="italic">Walpurgis nacht</hi> from the name of a saint who converted the Saxons 
                    to Christianity". As a detail possibly relevant to the tale in Ruskin's poem, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="emigration_of_the_sprites_apparatus.php#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                    Murray explains that, "at this annual conventicle (such is the common belief), all the evil spirits in the world assemble to offer allegiance to their unmentionable master, 
                    celebrating the festival with unholy orgies"

                    <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, "there is nothing in the MS. [i.e., MS VIII] to explain the reference here," and they suggest 
                    "that <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> had at this time formed some idea of the fairy story, with a German setting, which afterwards became 
                    <title type="story" corresp="#JRTHEKINGOFTHEGOLDENRIVER"><hi rend="italic">The King of the Golden River</hi></title>, or the allusion may be to 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title>, stanza x" 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:368 n. 1). The latter suggestion is not far-fetched, since Ruskin composed 
                    <ref type="apparatus" subtype="work" target="emigration_of_the_sprites_apparatus.php#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                    in <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msviii_apparatus.php#SECTIONF">MS VIII, section <hi rend="italic">f</hi></ref>, a section that he portioned off after allowing 
                    thirty blank leaves for continuing composition of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title> (i.e., 
                    <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msviii_apparatus.php#SECTIONE">MS VIII, section <hi rend="italic">e</hi></ref>, a section that he ultimately filled 
                    with drafts of other poems, after he abandoned work on the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>).</p>
                    
                    <p>Ruskin composed <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> probably in the winter of 1834-35, 
                        likely inspired by <title type="book" corresp="#BULWERLYTTONPILGRIMS"><hi rend="italic">Pilgrims of the Rhine</hi></title> 
                        (1834) by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in which English fairies accompany a human couple on a tour of the Rhine. Ruskin sets his tale in Britain, 
                        where the sprites hold a council, complaining of neglect and disbelief and therefore proposing to emigrate to Germany where legends of supernatural creatures are credited. 
                        As an English story, the inset tale is consistent with the Lake District setting for the story of Gough and his faithful dog, which Ruskin imports into 
                        <ref type="witness" target="the_summit_poem_msviii.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUMMIT">"The Summit"</title></ref> in imitation of Samuel Rogers, 
                        who uses digressive tales to vary the symmetrical structures and forward geographical sequence of <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. 
                        Unlike Rogers, whose tales are indigenous to the places where they occur in his tour poem, Ruskin prefers English stories, whether from familiarity or British pride or both.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the idea for <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> may have originated with the framing introduction 
                        of a narrator that Ruskin sets up at the end of the essay, <title type="essay" corresp="#JRTRADITIONSOFTHERHINE">&#x201C;The traditions of the Rhine have long been celebrated&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Rhine&#x201D;]</title>, 
                        by the time of composing the narrative poem Ruskin had probably abandoned any serious intention of uniting it with the essay in the unfinished fair-copy of the 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title> in MS IX. He had moved on, just as <title type="poem" corresp="#JREMIGRATIONOFSPRITES">&#x201C;The Emigration of the Sprites&#x201D;</title> 
                        advances beyond the octosyllabic couplets that predominate throughout the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>, 
                        to experiment with a twelve-line stanza. The stanza continues to rely on octosyllabic lines, but consists of a quartet, sestet, and couplet, built from a more ambitious rhyme scheme 
                        (abba cdcdcd ee)--an improvisation, perhaps, on a stanza type in Byron or Scott. Rather than planning the poem for the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title>, 
                        Ruskin perhaps destined it for the annuals--the public ambition that had swerved his attention from the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">Account</title> in the first place,
