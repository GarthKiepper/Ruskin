      <span id="TRANSPOSITIONGLOSS"><i>Lines 8&#x2013;9, transposition</i>&#x2014;<span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> composed lines 8 and 9 in the order shown here, 
                    but then transposed the lines as indicated by the addition of a numeral 1 in front of line 9, and of a numeral 2 in front of line 8.</span><br><br>
      
      <span id="SUBSTITUTIONGLOSS"><i>Line 43, substitution</i>&#x2014;In the left and right margin, 
                    line 43 is bracketed as if by large parentheses. Presumably, since the marks are in pencil like the other insertions by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s father, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>, in this draft, 
                    then it was he also who was responsible for these marks. Unlike other substitutions prompted by <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span> in this draft, 
                    this revision is not confirmed by <span class="persName-JR">John</span>&#x02BC;s overwriting in ink; however, the substitution did ultimately become incorporated in a version of this line for the published version,
                    <a href="../witnesses/saltzburg_fo.php">Saltzburg</a>. 
                    As the published version makes clear, <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s <i>while</i> should substitute for the phrase, <i>The weaker</i>, and not just for one word, <i>weaker</i>.</span><br><br>
