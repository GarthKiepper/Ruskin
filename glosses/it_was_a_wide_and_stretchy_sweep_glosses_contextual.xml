                    which encircled the interior of the building&#x02BC;s dome, but to the subordinate exhibits, which surrounded the building on its perimeter. By the time of the

                    had begun surrounding the structure with pleasure gardens, which contained a bewildering variety of attractions, amongst which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    singled out these seemingly random objects, although one can perhaps perceive a picturesque plan organizing the miscellany.</p>
                    
                    <p>The crocodile stools are explained by an <date when="1829">1829</date> aquatint by the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann firm</orgName>,

                        The scene in the print opens out to a large fountain from inside a &#x201C;treillage pavilion&#x201D; designed in the manner of <persName corresp="#HR">Humphry Repton</persName>. 
                        This pavilion apparently was never built at the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>, but the aquatint includes a garden seat fancifully 
                        speared by a reptile, its head protruding from one end, its tail curling outward from the other end, and its legs forming the stool&#x02BC;s frame. With unconscious irony, 
                        the print&#x02BC;s caption highlights the heterogeneous mixing of styles and objects: the scene &#x201C;represents the south side of the grounds which surround the building, 
                        embracing a picturesque trait of the beautiful union of Greek Architecture, thus judiciously combining with plants and flowering shrubs. The view is taken from the 
                        Corridor or covered way, leading from the interior of the structure [the trellised pavilion] to the first Fountain, whose refreshing showers are felt delightfully cooling 
                        after the ascent to the Gallery of the <title type="artwork" corresp="#HORNORSLONDONPANORAMA">Panorama</title>, 
                        and the circuit of the Pavilion enriched with so great a treasury of art. This enchanting spot leads through delightful alleys formed by extensive greenhouses, 
                        abounding in all the richest productions of <name type="fictional_person" corresp="#FLORA">Flora</name>, from almost every region, to the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Farm&#x2010;House</placeName>, 
                        from the verandah of which will be viewed the Rocky Scene, with the stupendous Water&#x2010;falls, and other objects, characteristic of the romantic and picturesque region 
                        which it is intended to describe. This part of the great scheme, when completed, it is believed, will amount to an illusion, having been prepared 
                        with rare skill and at a vast expense&#x201D;. Thus, the print&#x02BC;s caption leads the viewer from the crocodile stools shown in the print&#x02BC;s foreground 
                        to the other seemingly disassociated object in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s farrago, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</placeName>.

                    <p>The <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</placeName> exhibit was accessed via a subterranean passage, &#x201C;lined with coral, shells, and geological specimens&#x201D;,

                        The statue depicted a reclining figure, called the &#x201C;sleeping undine&#x201D; (or <hi rend="italic">ondine</hi>, a nymph), which lay at the center of a &#x201C;veil of water&#x201D; 
                        thrown upward and around the figure, and falling down onto shells, corals, and mosses, as a &#x201C;dial of shells&#x201D; revolved above&#x2014;the whole enclosed inside a glass dome topped with a flowery finial. 
                        The enclosed design of the fountain, along with its connection to a subterranean passage decorated with shells and fossil specimens, suggests a grotto&#x2014;a 
                        classical feature in picturesque landscape design, which hearkened back to Greek mythology and to the Roman <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi> or fountain consecrated to water nymphs. 
                        According to the caption of the <orgName corresp="#ACKERMANN">Ackermann</orgName> print, the experience of the undine fountain was completed when &#x201C;the spectator . . .

                        The exhibit was composed of four full&#x2010;scale room interiors, which were built outside the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>,

                        he provides floor plans and elevations, as well as full renderings in landscape settings, of a &#x201C;Swiss Cottage&#x201D; and a &#x201C;Swiss Farm House&#x201D;

                        he adapts the Swiss chalet style (as well as several other styles) to villa architecture. As <persName corresp="#JSACKERMAN">James Ackerman</persName> comments,

                        This eclecticism was an outgrowth of the shift in the aesthetics and sociology of the British villa&#x2014;from emulation of <persName corresp="#AP">Palladio</persName> by elites 
                        in the earlier eighteenth century, entailing the Platonic notion that architecture imitated nature conceptually, &#x201C;exemplifying the principles of harmony in the universe&#x201D;, 
                        to the revolution in taste for the picturesque, entailing a psychology of associationism and democratic individualism, allowing &#x201C;the designer to give his work 
                        whatever character he believed to be suited to his client, the nature of the setting, or the function of the building&#x201D;

                    <p><persName corresp="#THP">Hornor</persName>, as an experienced landscape architect and surveyor, was able to complement his main attraction, the enormous panorama,

                        The charm of the sublime in miniature still held in <date when="1848">1848</date>, when <persName corresp="#EMW">Edward Mogg</persName> in his tourist&#x02BC;s guide

                        The Rocky Scene, however, reflected the ups and downs of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#COLOSSEUM">Colosseum</placeName>&#x02BC;s fortunes over the years.

                        These plans failed to prosper, however, and the <placeName type="building" corresp="#SWISSCOTTAGECOLOSSEUM">Swiss Cottage</placeName> gained only a miserable eagle, 
                        the survivor of a shuttered menagerie. While the bird perched haplessly on the miniature scenery outside the windows, refreshments were sold on the inside 
                        by a Cockney in Swiss costume. Later, in <date when="1845">1845</date>, another entrepreneur oversaw a more successful re&#x2010;opening, for which the Swiss scenery

                    even more treacherous than the ascent, since wintry weather had rendered the barren ground slippery with snow and ice, which the pack animals made worse by trampling

                    <p><quote>At length, after the men and beasts of burden had been fatigued to no purpose, the camp was pitched on the summit, the ground being cleared for that purpose 
                        with great difficulty, so much snow was there to be dug out and carried away. The soldiers being then set to make a way down the cliff, 
                        by which alone a passage could be effected, and it being necessary that they should cut through the rocks, having felled and lopped a number of large trees 
                        which grew around, they make a huge pile of timber; and as soon as a strong wind fit for exciting the flames arose, they set fire to it, and, 
                        pouring vinegar on the heated stones, they render them soft and crumbling. They then open a way with iron instruments through the rock thus heated by the fire, 
                        and soften its declivities by gentle windings, so that not only the beasts of burden, but also the elephants could be led down it. Four days were spent 
                        about this rock, the beasts nearly perishing through hunger: for the summits of the mountains are for the most part bare, and if there is any pasture the snows bury it. 
                        The lower parts contain valleys, and some sunny hills, and rivulets flowing beside woods, and scenes more worthy of the abode of man. 
                        There the beasts of burden were sent out to pasture, and rest given for three days to the men, fatigued with forming the passage: 
                        they then descended into the plains, the country and the dispositions of the inhabitants being now less rugged.</quote></p>
