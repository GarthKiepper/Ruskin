                    the drowning of Percy Shelley in the Ligurean Sea off the coast of Leghorn in July 1822, 
                    Byron moved his household in October to Genoa, where Mary Shelley had already arrived. 
                    Joined by his lover, Teresa Guiccioli, and his companion, Edward John Trelawny, Byron leased Casa Saluzzo in the suburb Albaro, 
                    while Mary Shelley along with Leigh Hunt and his family occupied Casa Negroto nearby. 
                    Byron lived here until he and Trelawny sailed for Greece in July 1823

                        based on visits exchanged with Byron during Lady Blessington's stay in Genoa with her husband and companions, April-June 1823. 
                        In the Conversations, she describes Byron's residence thus: 
                        "Albaro, the village in which the Casa Saluzzo, 
                        where he lives, is situated, is about a mile and a 
                        half distant from Genoa ; it is a fine old palazzo, 
                        commanding an extensive view, and with spacious 
                        apartments, the front looking into a court-yard

                    3 July, Mary Richardson records that the family, after visiting Arona on Lake Maggiore, crossed to Varese and ascended the Madonna del Monte. 
                    She notes the chapels situated along the ascent (incorrectly connecting them the stations of the cross) and the view from the summit, 
                    which she and John enjoyed from a steeple that they ascended accompanied by Salvador 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, 63-64). According to the guidebook by <persName corresp="#GBM">G. B. Maule</persName>, 
                    "The chief object of attraction at Varese is the celebrated Santuario of the Virgin, caUed La Madonna del Monte, 
                    which is situated on a lofty hill about five miles to the north-west of the city. It is said to have been founded in 397 
                    by St. Ambrose, to commemorate a  great victory,—-not in argument, but in arms,—-gained by him on this spot over the Arians. 
                    The slaughter is said to have been so great that the heterodox party were exterminated. It was dedicated to the Virgin, and her statue, 
                    which was consecrated by St. Ambrose, is still preserved. At the end of the 16th century Agaggiari, a Capuchin monk, built, out of funds raised by his exertions, 
                    the fourteen chapels which stand by the side of the road which leads to the church on the summit. . . . The fourteen chapels represent the 
                    fourteen mysteries of the Rosary. . . . They contain coloured statues in stucco, . . . and frescoes . . . of the painters of the Milanese school of the 16th century. 
                    Over the fountain, near the last chapel, is a fine colossal statue of Moses. . . . Connected with the chureh is a convent of Augustinian nuns. . . . 
                    Those who are not tempted by the religions objects may be perhaps induced to visit the Santuario by being told that the ascent affords the most magnificent views 
                    of the rich plain of Lombardy as far as the Apennines, of the higher and lower chains of the Alps, and the lakes of Varese, Comabbio, Biandrone, Monate, Maggiore, and Como
