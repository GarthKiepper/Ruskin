Nonplussed by these modern urban public spaces, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> 
                    responded enthusiastically to the Gothic cathedral, a preference that led early in the development of the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNT">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s only completed poem about <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>,

                    In that poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> emphasizes the vertical thrust of the carthedral, comparing its spires to <geogName corresp="#MONTEROSA">Monte Rosa</geogName> rising on the city&#x02BC;s horizon, 
                    whereas he projected, but evidently neglected to draft, the poem or essay on the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Corso</placeName>, which would have expressed some view of the horizontal axes and breadth of the <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Enlightenment city</placeName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The modernization of the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Corso di Porta Orientale</placeName> (also known as the <placeName corresp="#PORTAVENEZIA">Porta Venezia</placeName>) was begun in 1<date when="1827">1827</date> and completed in the year of the Ruskins&#x02BC; visit, <date when="1833">1833</date>. 
                        Designed by <persName corresp="#RVANTINI">Rodolfo Vantini</persName> (<date notBefore="1792" notAfter="1856">1792-1856</date>), the gateway is marked by a pair of cubical structures that, like the <placeName type="building" corresp="#BRANDEBURGGATE">Brandeburg Gate</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#BERLIN">Berlin</placeName>, 
                        evoke the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PROPYLAEAATHENS">Propylaea of the Acropolis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#ATHENS">Athens</placeName>. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such structures heralded the entrance to the city as "work of art" 
                        (Etlin 2-4; and see Olsen). In <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, the planning for these neoclassical monuments began under the Enlightenment administration of the Hapsburgs, 
                        overseen by the architect, <persName corresp="#GPIERMARINI">Giuseppe Piermarini</persName> (<date notBefore="1734" notAfter="1808">1734-1808</date>). His most famous work, the <placeName type="building" corresp="#TEATROALLASCALA">Teatro alla Scala</placeName> (<date notBefore="1776" notAfter="1778">1776-78</date>), was visited by the Ruskins, 
                        although they were unable to attend a performance there, but <persName corresp="#GPIERMARINI">Piermarini</persName>&#x02BC;s plans for neoclassical renovation were apparent throughout the city. 
                        By the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830</date>s, however, the Hapsburg project had been overlain by <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for the city, which appropriated the neoclassical design 
                        to promote republican and imperial ideals. This symbolism was often expressed using a columnar, Doric vocabulary associated with <placeName corresp="#PAESTUM">Paestum</placeName>. 
                        The Ruskins appear to have sought out these Napoleonic monuments, including a vast &#x201C;amphitheatre&#x201D;, referring apparently to the <placeName corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</placeName> (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1806">1801-6</date>), 
                        planned by <persName corresp="#GAANTOLINI">Giovanni Antonio Antolini</persName> (<date notBefore="1756" notAfter="1841">1756-1841</date>) as a spectacular entrance to the city from the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Strada del Sempione</geogName>, 
                        connecting to the <geogName corresp="#SIMPLON">Simplon Pass</geogName>, which <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s engineers had modernized as an accessible carriage road. The <placeName type="building" corresp="#FOROBONAPARTE">Foro Bonaparte</placeName> was completed in altered form 
                        by Luigi Canonica (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1844">1762-1844</date>). At its entrance on the city side, the Ruskins also viewed the arch commemorating <persName corresp="#NBE">Napeoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s victory at <placeName corresp="#MARENGO">Marengo</placeName> (now known as the <placeName type="building" corresp="#ARCODELLAPACE">Arco della Pace</placeName>), 
                        designed by Luigi Cagnola (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1833">1762-1833</date>), begun in <date notBefore="1807">1807</date> and still incomplete when the Ruskins visited. On their last day in <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, they viewed <persName corresp="#MLCAGNOLA">Cagnola</persName>&#x02BC;s city gate built 
                        &#x201C;in memory of [<persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName>&#x02BC;s] victory at <placeName corresp="#MARENGO">Marengo</placeName>&#x201D;, today known as the <placeName type="building" corresp="#PORTATICINESE">Porta Ticinese</placeName> (<date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1814">1801-14</date>) (Kirk 77-83, 91-98).</p></note>

                        to commemorate a great victory,&#x2014;not in argument, but in arms,&#x2014;gained by him on this spot over the <orgName corresp="#ARIANS">Arians</orgName>. 
                        The slaughter is said to have been so great that the heterodox party were exterminated. It was dedicated to the <persName type="scriptural_person" corresp="#VIRGINMARY">Virgin</persName>, 
                        and her statue, which was consecrated by <persName corresp="#STAMBROSE">St. Ambrose</persName>, is still preserved. At the end of the <date notBefore="1500" notAfter="1599">16th century</date>

                        which stand by the side of the road which leads to the church on the summit. . . . The fourteen chapels represent the fourteen mysteries of the Rosary. . . . They contain coloured statues

                        is not older than the <date notBefore="1400" notAfter="1499">15th century</date>, but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">canton Vaud</placeName> 
                        with the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">canton Vallais</placeName>; and a gate at one end, now removed, formerly served to close the passage up and down: 
                        a circumstance alluded to in the lines of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>. A small fort was erected by the Swiss in <date when="1832">1832</date>, above the road,

                        emphasizes an invidious distinction typically made by British Victorian tourists between Protestant and Catholic Swiss cantons:

                        Their physical condition is lamentable; no part of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> is afflicted to a greater extent with the maladies of go&#x00EE;tre and cretinism . . . ,
