                        is not older than the <date notBefore="1400" notAfter="1499">15th century</date>, but may possibly rest on Roman foundations. It unites the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">canton Vaud</placeName>

                        emphasizes an invidious distinction typically made by British Victorian tourists between Protestant and Catholic Swiss cantons: 
                        &#x201C;No one can cross the <placeName corresp="#SAINTMAURICEBRIDGE">bridge of St. Maurice</placeName> without being struck with the change in the condition of the inhabitants of the two cantons. The neatness and industry 
                        of the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVAUD">Vaudois</placeName> are exchanged within the space of a few hundred yards for filth and beggary, equally apparent in the persons and habitations of the <placeName corresp="#CANTONVALAIS">Vallaisans</placeName>. 
                        Their physical condition is lamentable; no part of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName> is afflicted to a greater extent with the maladies of go&#x00EE;tre and cretinism . . . , 
                        and the victims of them shock the traveller&#x02BC;s sight at every step&#x201D;
