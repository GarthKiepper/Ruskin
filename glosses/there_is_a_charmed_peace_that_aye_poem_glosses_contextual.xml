                    The family viewed the falls before breakfast on the morning of <date when="1833-06-10">June 10</date>, the day after their Sabbath sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                    described in this poem. <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> declared the view &#x201C;second only to the <geogName corresp="ALPS">Alps</geogName> in grandeur,&#x201D; 
                    mentioning that the family crossed to the opposite side of the river for a prospect, and that they also viewed the scene in a camera obscura 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 37). 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">Smith</persName> notes that early morning, the time chosen by the Ruskins, was among the most advantageous, &#x201C;when the Iris floats 
                    within the spray&#x201D;; however, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName>&#x02BC;s opinion that the vantage from the opposite side of the river was &#x201C;inferior&#x201D; 
                    is not shared by <persName corresp="#JM">Smith</persName> (if indeed they refer to the same vantage point). <persName corresp="#JM">Smith</persName> advises: 
                    &#x201C;The best mode of visiting the falls from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName> is to hire a boat from thence . . . , 
                    and descend the river, which already forms a succession of rapids, by no means dangerous under the guidance of a boatman accustomed to the river. When the increased celerity 
                    of the current and the audible roar announce that the skiff is approaching the falls, the steersman makes for the l. bank, and lands his passengers under 
                    the picturesque castle of <placeName type="building" corresp="#LAUFENCASTLE"><hi rend="italic">Lauffen</hi></placeName>, situated on a high rock overlooking the fall, within the Canton of Zurich. 
                    It is occupied and rented by an artist who speaks English, and charges 1 franc admission for each person. The advantage of approaching the fall on this side is, 
                    that nothing is seen of it until it is at once presented in its most magnificent point of view, from the little pavilion perched on the edge of the cliff immediately above it. 
                    Its appearance from the opposite side of the river is tame in comparison, and the first impression from thence, made by the finest cataract in Europe, 
                    will most probably prove disappointing&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKSWITZERLAND1838"><hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName></hi></title></ref>, 19).</p></note>

                    which was nearly setting and cast a pink shade on the snowy peaks; it is the grandest and most sublime sight I have ever seen, no picture, no panorama 
                    can give the least idea of these magnificent mountains. The beautiful landscape near us through which the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> winds with its richly cultivated fields and vineyards, 
                    formed a fine contrast with the snowy mountains in the distance&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>, 36).

                    The ride up to highest peak, the <geogName corresp="#MONTRIGIKULM">Rigi Kulm</geogName>, was a popular tourist attraction, which the Ruskins undertook on <date when="1833-07-25">25 July 1833</date>

                    The popularity of the excursion, according to <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>, owed &#x201C;less to its height . . . than to its isolated situation.&#x201D; 
                    &#x201C;Separated from other mountains,&#x201D; and surrounded by lakes on three sides, &#x201C;in the midst of some of the most beautiful scenery of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, [the summit] . . . allows an uninterrupted view from it on all sides, 
                    and [is] convert[ed] . . . into a natural observatory,&#x201D; commanding &#x201C;a panorama hardly to be equalled in extent and grandeur among the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>&#x201D;

                    Four decades after his first sighting of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote, in letter 34 (<date when="1873-10">October 1873</date>) of <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title>,

                    This would have been a different perspective, pivoting the view much farther west, 
                    toward the mountains above <geogName corresp="#LAKEGENEVA">Lake Geneva</geogName> rather than toward the <geogName corresp="#MONTRIGI">Rigi</geogName> above <geogName corresp="#LAKELUCERNE">Lake Lucerne</geogName>.</p></note>

                        In the list, he lines up a cluster of individual pieces (or composite sections, the list providing no indication of the genres intended by the titles) 
                        that revolve around the experience of one&#x02BC;s first sighting of the <geogName corresp="ALPS">Alps</geogName>. While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> gave no title in draft of the present poem,

                        (see textual notes), he probably intended the poem to occupy the position denoted in the list as <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHEALPSCOMP">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>.</p>
