                    In 1813, the year of the poem's publication, the young <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> penned a wry account of the narrative to his mother, 
                    <persName corresp="#CTWR">Catherine</persName>, predicting that it 
                    "will never be much read &#x0026; I hope the Reviewers will assist in checking the career of such loose &#x0026; foolish poems. Mr. Scott 
                    consulted his fame in writing <title type="poem" corresp="#SCOTTMARMION">Marmion</title> &#x0026; the <title type="poem" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTREL">Minstrel</title>&#x2014;if 
                    he continues to value his fame he will write no more". 
                    John James especially scoffed at the character of <name type="fictional" corresp="#WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</name>, a boy who is 
                    "very tender hearted, mild, shy, innocent, amorous, &#x0026; sickly, very studious moreover," 
                    and who "prefers sitting up all night hearing the wind howl &#x0026; looking at the moon" in order to write poems about it, rather than "going like other folks to bed. . . . 
                    I expected the first Canto was to send this weekly youth to his grave in a galloping consumption . . . when lo! &#x0026; behold he breaks out upon us all at once 
                    with a song &#x0026; seems as well &#x0026; merry as possible considering that he had nothing but the moon to sing to &#x0026; not even a pipe nor a pot of porter to comfort him withall." 
                    John James could not have predicted how uncannily the character would conform, two decades later, with that of the young John Ruskin

                    <p>In 1823, a drawing of this <geogName corresp="#TEESDALE">Teesdale</geogName> landscape by J. M. W. Turner was published as

                    Ruskin could also have had access to another, very different conception of this subject by Turner,
