                decision to isolate the word <i>so</i> on its own line here does not appear in keeping with

                evidence that the <span class="persName-JR">author</span> intended <i>so</i> to belong to the line
                &#x201C;was better than our mouses so&#x201D; may be found in the fact that <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s
