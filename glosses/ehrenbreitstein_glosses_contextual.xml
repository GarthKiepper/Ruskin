                    the hill of <geogName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</geogName>, fortifications of the same name had been erected from Roman through medieval times. In <date when ="1833">1833</date>, 
                    scarce any vestige remained of the ancient architecture, the fortress having been destroyed by French troops in <date when="1801">1801</date> and rebuilt by <placeName corresp="#PRUSSIA">Prussia</placeName> after <date when="1815">1815</date>, 
                    as a practical enforcement of its power in <date notBefore="1815">post&#x2010;Napoleonic</date> <placeName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</placeName>. Despite the now utilitarian character of the works, 
                    artists and tourists persisted in romanticizing the site (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TAYLORCASTLES"><persName corresp="#RRT">Taylor</persName>, <title corresp="#TAYLORCASTLES">Castles of the Rhine</title></ref>, 98&#x2013;111). 
                    <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> helped to popularize the site by commemorating the recent conflict over the fortress in canto 3 (<date when="1816">1816</date>), 
                    stanza 58, of <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title>

                    Writing in mid&#x2010;1830s, the English artist and teacher, <persName corresp="#JML">James Mathews Leigh</persName> (<date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1860">1808&#x2013;60</date>), 
                    admitted no illusions about the regrettable loss of the antique ruins, but could still perceive the artistic appeal of the site: 
                    &#x201C;The whole surface of the rock glowed with the richest hues of sunset; its naturally deep&#x2010;toned and richly&#x2010;coloured form assuming an endless diversity of tints, 
                    combined into a focus of harmonious light, and relieved by the broad shadows of the surrounding objects. A multitude of beautiful parts subdued to a general breadth of effect 
                    will be the description best understood by the learned in art. . . . Beautiful as it is, crowned by the pride of modern masonry, and the intricate contrivances of modern engineering, 
                    it possessed far more romantic beauty in the former dismantled state of the shattered fortress bearing the picturesque traces of ruthless violence&#x201D;

                    peculiar to the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEIN">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, lines 35&#x2013;38 introduced changes in the 
                    <date when="1850">1850</date> text, but the revision is based on a version of these lines as they had been altered using deletion and addition in the 
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, alterations that were abandoned for the original version in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                    fair copy. That is, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> originally composed 
                    &#x201C;The rivers pass full playfully, / . . . / The river tosses by&#x201D;; and in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> he fair&#x2010;copied those lines. 
                    But <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> also shows an alteration of these lines to &#x201C;They pass together playfully / . . . / The torrent tosses by&#x201D;; 
                    and this version is what appears in the <date when="1850">1850</date> and <date when="1903">1903</date> texts. Thus, we have evidence that the compilers of the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1850)</title></ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>, were interested in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    earlier rough drafts of poetry. Alternatively, it is possible that the revisions in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> were not ignored 
                    in <date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date> when fair&#x2010;copying the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>,

                    The hand in which the changes are made in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> does appear to be that of the younger 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, but such small changes allow meager basis for analysis.</p>

                    was described by the artist <persName corresp="#JML">James Mathews Leigh</persName>, writing from <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> at about the same time as the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey: 
                    &#x201C;I was . . . startled at the cries which accompanied the apparent destruction of the bridge of boats, fragments of which were floating away 
                    from the main body. . . . A majestic raft of the largest dimensions was floating down the river to its ultimate destination. The measured voices of the innumerable rowers 
                    who laboured at either end of the enormous mass had an imposing effect as they mingled with the splashings of their ample paddles. The <hi rend="italic">deck</hi> was covered with their cabins, 
                    and at different points were elevated stations from which the word of command was given by tongue of trumpet. No notion can be formed of the quantity of timber employed in these rafts 
                    from a sight of their extended forms on the water. . . . [T]here are sometimes from seven to nine hundred workmen and rowers employed. 
                    The largest rafts are generally from seven to nine hundred feet long and seventy broad, and are composed of the produce of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, the <geogName corresp="#BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</geogName>, 
                    and the fir forests of the <geogName corresp="#MURG">Murg</geogName>, which is brought to <placeName corresp="#DORDRECHT">Dordrecht</placeName>, there to be distributed and conveyed to the various foreign and domestic markets. . . . 
                    This striking object passed majestically through the gap in the bridge, and in a very short time the barges were rejoined and the promenaders resumed their stations [on the bridge]&#x201D;

                    is difficult to trace, since he shifts his target somewhat, directing his scorn in the latter essay against &#x201C;the generality of the German peasantry and lower classes&#x201D;. 
                    This target seems to rule out the phobia that had been widespread among Britons a few decades earlier, a suspicion of German literary culture and aesthetics, especially Gothic terror 
                    and the sublime. Nonetheless, within the Ruskin family, the clearest echo of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s anti&#x2010;German narrator is <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s contempt 
                    for German tourists encountered during the <ref type="note" target="tour_of_1833_note.php">Tour of 1833,</ref> whom he caricatured as a &#x201C;Nation&#x201D; supposed to be &#x201C;fond of the

                    If they seek sublime horror, it must be &#x201C;the horrors of Indigestion&#x201D; that they most feel &#x201C;as they are great Gormandizers&#x201D;; if a sentimental people.

                    Any other pronouncements that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> may have recorded about the <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">German</placeName> people during the tour have been lost, 
                    since the surviving portion of his travel diary begins with the family&#x02BC;s arrival in <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>. Still, his remarks about the contradictory 
                    and self&#x2010;thwarting nature of a debased love of the sublime and unsentimental sentiment are consistent with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s ridicule of 
                    German Romantic aesthetics that can be found in his letters.</p>
                    
                    <p>In his youth, at age sixteen in <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> had acted a part in an amateur staging of

                        by <persName corresp="#MGL">Matthew Gregory (&#x201C;Monk&#x201D;) Lewis</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1818">1775&#x2013;1818</date>), the most lionized 
                        and  most reviled British imitator of the German terrible sublime. As Ruskin family lore had it, according to <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERTIA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s performance stirred his future fianc&#x00E9;e, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, with admirmation of the handsome figure 
                        he cut onstage in his romantic costume, despite her religious antipathy to &#x201C;theatricals&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38). 
                        In the course of their long engagement, however, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> came round to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>>&#x02BC;s contempt for Gothic. 
                        In a letter of <title type="letter" corresp="jr_to_mr_1813-03-04">4 March 1813</title> (part of which is missing), <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>

                        &#x201C;always threaten &#x0026; announce more than they perform&#x201D;, whereas the sentimental boy <persName type="fictional_person" corresp="#WILFRIDWYCLIFFE">Wilfrid</persName> 
                        &#x201C;is very tender hearted, mild, shy, innocent, amorous, &#x0026; sickly, very studious moreover&#x201D;, prone to &#x201C;sitting up all night hearing the wind howl &#x0026; looking at the moon&#x201D;, 
                        instead of &#x201C;going like other folks to bed&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 60). 
                        The epithet &#x201C;sickly&#x201D; was commonly applied to German drama by British critics, who warned that the importation of these plays would expose the British public to political subversion and moral depravity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Starting in the <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1799">1790s</date> and extending through the <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic Era</date>, 
                        British fears of invasion by the French extended to anxieties about &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; by German romance, 
                        which was imported in the form of translations of tragedies and melodramas by <persName corresp="#JCFS">Schiller</persName>, <persName corresp="#AFFK">Kotzebue</persName>, and 
                        <persName corresp="#JWG">Goethe</persName>, and of translations and adaptations of Romantic ballads such as <title type="poem" corresp="#BURGERLENORE">&#x201C;Lenore&#x201D;</title> 
                        by <persName corresp="#GAB">G. A. B&#x00FC;rger</persName>. As <persName corresp="#PM">Peter Mortensen</persName> has argued, 
                        British authors attracted to the German sublime in drama and the ballad had to reckon with a British xenophobic reaction 
                        while at the same time capitalizing on the fashion for German literary supernaturalism 
                        (<persName corresp="#PM">Mortensen</persName>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MORTENSENEUROPHOPIA"><title type="book" corresp="#MORTENSENEUROPHOPIA"><hi rend="italic">British Romanticism and Continental Influences</hi></title></ref>, 26&#x2013;27, 46). 
                        <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> was caught in this dilemma early in his career as a poet, when <persName corresp="#MGL">Lewis</persName> invited him to contribute 
                        his translations of German ballads to the collection, <title type="anthology" corresp="#LEWISTALESOFWONDER"><hi rend="italic">Tales of Wonder</hi></title> (<date when="1800">1800</date>). 
                        <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> did not, however, take the risk of appearing among scandalous and allegedly &#x201C;Jacobinical&#x201D; company merely for the sake of success in the literary market; 
                        like some other British poets, such as <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> was drawn to German poetry in the belief that it shared 
                        a common heritage with Scottish poetry, and that the fashion for the German sublime could aid in the renewal of British poetry, which he considered moribund. 
                        For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, this ideological orientation to the past may present a more significant, if indirect connection with German Romantic literary culture 
                        than is apparent in the superficial prejudice against &#x201C;German brains&#x201D; that he inherited from his father.</p>
                    
                    <p>For <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, this ideological tie to <persName corresp="#MGL">Lewis</persName> and the German sublime is revealed in the series of biographical prefaces 
                        he added to his major poems in <date when="1830">1830</date>, starting with the <title type="essay" corresp="#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS">&#x201C;Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad&#x201D;</title> 
                        prefacing the fourth volume of <title type="anthology" corresp="#SCOTTMINSTRELSY"><hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</hi></title>. By this time, German literature had shed its stigma 
                        for British readers, and <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> was able to disassociate his youthful pursuit from French political freethinking. His study of German language and poetics brought an 
                        &#x201C;unexpected discovery of an old friend in a foreign land&#x201D;, which promised an &#x201C;emancipation from the rules so servilely adhered to by the French school, . . . 
                        particularly by their dramatic poets&#x201D;; and while this affiliation brought &#x201C;some disadvantages&#x201D; in the form of German &#x201C;extravagance and bombast&#x201D;, 
                        <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> and his associates in <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> anticipated that the &#x201C;prevailing taste in . . . 
                        [<placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>] might be easily employed as a formidable auxiliary to renewing the spirit of our own, upon the same system as when medical persons 
                        attempt, by the transfusion of blood, to pass into the veins of an aged and exhausted patient, the vivacity of the circulation and liveliness of sensation which distinguish a young subject&#x201D;. 
                        <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s access to this new blood was fortuitously encouraged by his acquaintance with <persName corresp="#MGL">&#x201C;Monk&#x201D; Lewis</persName>, 
                        whose &#x201C;education abroad&#x201D; had afforded &#x201C;an opportunity of indulging his inclination for the extraordinary and supernatural, by wandering through the whole enchanted land 
                        of German faëry and <hi rend="italic">diablerie</hi>, not forgetting the paths of her enthusiastic tragedy and romantic poetry&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#MGL">Lewis</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        influence could help add &#x201C;a new string to the British harp&#x201D;, as he was already a popularly &#x201C;successful imitator of the Germans, both in his attachment to the ancient ballad, 
                        and in the tone of superstition which they [the German poets] willingly mingle with it&#x201D;; and he was a &#x201C;martinet, if I may so term him, in the accuracy of rhymes and of numbers&#x201D; 
                        and his &#x201C;command over the melody of verse&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS"><persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>, <title type="essay" corresp="#SCOTTESSAYONIMITATIONS">&#x201C;Essay on Imitations of the Ancient Ballad&#x201D;</title>, ed. Thomson</ref>, n.p.).</p>
                    
                    <p>Other participants in this movement included <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, whose ballads in an ancient style were admired by the <orgName corresp="#NORWICHSCHOOL">Norwich School</orgName> 
                        of poets, which included the most successful English translator of <persName corresp="#GAB">B&#x00FC;rger</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#BURGERLENORE">&#x201C;Lenore&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#WTPOET">William Taylor</persName> (<date notBefore="1765" notAfter="1836">1765&#x2013;1836</date>). <persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">David Chandler</persName> 
                        has illuminated how this context brings into focus <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s rivalry with <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName> over the ballad revival, 
                        which has been perceived as merely personal in its motivation on <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s part. In his approach to literary revival, <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        &#x201C;recipe for a modern supernatural ballad&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">Chandler</persName> explains, &#x201C;was to take a genuinely old story concerned with a supernatural event 
                        and to write it as if with complete faith in its credibility, &#x2018;in the spirit of the elder poets&#x2019;&#x201D;. It was in defense of this approach that <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName> 
                        scorned <persName corresp="#STC">Coleridge</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#STCANCIENTMARINER">&#x201C;The Ancient Mariner&#x201D;</title> 
                        as &#x201C;a Dutch attempt at German sublimity&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#DCHANDLER">Chandler</persName> concludes that &#x201C;what <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName> 
                        with professional rivalry dismissed as a &#x2018;Dutch attempt&#x2019;, and <persName corresp="#CLE">[Charles] Lamb</persName> more generously defended as an &#x2018;English attempt&#x2019; 
                        at &#x2018;German sublimity&#x2019;, is a poem [&#x2018;The Ancient Mariner&#x2019;] particularly apt for critics who read the past as continuous with the present 
                        and believe in the power of tradition. On the other hand, <persName corresp="#RS">Southey</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x2018;answer&#x2019;, an attempt at genuine &#x2018;German sublimity&#x2019; 
                        [his ballad, <title type="poem" corresp="RSOLDWOMANOFBERKELEY">&#x2018;The Old Woman of Berkeley&#x2019;</title>], is a poem for critics who see the past as discontinuous with the present, 
                        but recoverable in part through an effort of difficult, but rewarding, sympathetic identification&#x201D;
