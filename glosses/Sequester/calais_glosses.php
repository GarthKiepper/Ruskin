                    As a substitution, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> devised his own line, printing it in square brackets, as shown in the <span class="date-1891">1891</span> witness. 
                    The editors of the <a href="../notes/library_edition_note.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">Library Edition</a> disagreed; and in 
                    the <span class="date-1903">1903</span> witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; &#x005B;poem&#x005D;, they restored <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s original line, 
                    arguing that &#x201C;the young author, as we have seen in the case of the <a href="../apparatuses/iteriad_apparatus.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">&#x2018;Iteriad&#x2019;</a>, 
                    was not always careful to get a true rhyme, and &#x005B;that&#x005D; the meaning &#x005B;of the original line 2 of &#x2018;Calais&#x2019;&#x005D; is clear enough&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2: 341 n. 2).
                    
                    <br/>In hypothesizing a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost,&#x201D; <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> evidently meant a draft version preceding not only 
                    the MS IX fair&#x2010;copy witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; &#x005B;poem&#x005D;, 
                    but also the MS IA, <i>g</i>.1, witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; &#x005B;poem&#x005D;&#x2014;the 
                    earliest extant version, which is in the hand of <span class="persName-JJR">John James Ruskin</span>, and which shows interlinear corrections by his son. 
                    In the latter version, line 2 is identical to that in the fair&#x2010;copy version. 
                    That <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> was familiar with the 
                        MS IA, <i>g</i>.1 version, 
                        and was referring to this manuscript as containing the &#x201C;original&#x201D; version of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; &#x005B;poem&#x005D;, 
                    is indicated by his having accepted lines 5&#x2013;6 as originally composed in that version, in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                    and by his implicitly rejecting <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s revision of those lines in that same MS IA, <i>g</i>.1 version.
                    The manuscript holding the MS IA, <i>g</i>.1 version  
                        is presently the sole surviving manuscript source of lines 5&#x2013;6, 
                    which <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> preferred, 
                        <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> having carried his own, not his father&#x02BC;s, version of these lines to the 
                        MS IX fair copy.
                    
                    <br/>In arriving at his published version of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; &#x005B;poem&#x005D;, <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span> appears therefore 
                        to have based his editorial decisions on his own aesthetic judgment, 
                    since his choices overall are consistent neither with the &#x201C;original&#x201D; in <span class="persName-JJR">John James</span>&#x02BC;s hand 
                        nor with the final version in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s, even substituting a line of his own invention where he dislikes both versions. 
                    The editors of the Library Edition, <span class="persName-ETC">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName-">Alexander Wedderburn</span>, 
                        seem somewhat more consistent 
                        in preferring <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s final, fair&#x2010;copy version, although their decisions are as eclectic and aesthetically driven as 
                        <span class="persName-WGC">Collingwood</span>&#x02BC;s in accepting the latter&#x02BC;s re&#x2010;punctuation of the poem in combination with some punctuation 
                        found in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s fair copy. 
                        <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-">Wedderburn</span> clearly, too, had access to the witnesses 
                        &#x201C;in both the rough and in the fair copy,&#x201D; as they call them&#x2014;meaning, by the &#x201C;rough&#x201D; witness, 
                    what they called <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy,&#x201D; 
                        which is the manuscript containing the <i>g</i>.1 version 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE" target="_blank" class="inactive">Ruskin, <i>Works</i></a>, 2:341 n. 2).
                    
                    <br/>By <span class="date-1903">1903</span>, the manuscript containing the <i>g</i>.1 version must have been bound as part of 
                        <a href="../apparatuses/apparatus_msia.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a>, a compilation that <span class="persName-ETC">Cook</span> and <span class="persName-">Wedderburn</span> 
                        added to Collingwood&#x02BC;s list of manuscripts in &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;

                        This manuscript, at least, would have been included in what the editors identify among the contents of <a href="../apparatuses/apparatus_msia.html" target="_blank" class="inactive">MS IA</a>

                    were based on experience. In her journal of the tour, <a href="../notes/richardson_mary_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span></a> 
                    wrote that, on their first day in <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, after settling with customs, 
                    the family toured the cathedral (&#x201C;very beautiful but not so clean as our English churches&#x201D;). 
                    Then she and <span class="persName-JR">John</span> sketched the sitting room of the hotel where they stayed (which she named, or the diary&#x02BC;s transcriber interpreted, 
                    as &#x201C;L&#x02BC;hotel de Bourbon or Rossignol&#x201D;). 
                    Venturing outside again, the children&#x2014;accompanied by the cicerone, <a href="../notes/salvador_note.php" target="_blank">Salvador</a>,

                    (&#x201C;a little France, a miniature picture&#x201D;). Similarly, in her journal of the tour, 
                    <a href="../notes/richardson_mary_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> (1815&#x2013;49)</a>

                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#RFT48" target="_blank" class="inactive">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</a>, p. 1). Guidebooks and travel accounts of the period tended to take a more practical view, 
                    portraying the port city in terms of British travelers&#x02BC; complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example, 
                    <i>Heath&#x02BC;s Picturesque Annual for <span class="date-1832">1832</span></i>, which warns that, in <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, 
                    &#x201C;the communication between the strangers and natives is full of strife and wrangling or silent bitterness&#x201D;

                    Whereas <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the <span class="geogName-ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</span> crossing, into a topic for picturesque contrasts of scenery and costume, 
                    <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>&#x02BC;s <span class="date-1836">1836</span> guidebook emphasizes the comforts of familiarity: <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span> &#x201C;is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken&#x201D;
