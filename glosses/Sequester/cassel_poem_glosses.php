      <span id="STOMERSPLAINGLOSS"><i>Omers plain</i>&#x2014;The town of <span class="placeName-STOMER">Saint&#x2010;Omer</span> was the first location of <span class="orgName-STOMERSCOLLEGE">St. Omers College</span>. 
                    Starting in the 1590s, to evade persecution, English Catholics sent their children to be educated at this Jesuit school. 
                    The school was closed by the <i>arrêt</i> of the <span class="orgName-PARISPARLEMENT">Paris Parlement</span> of 1762, the decree aimed at the expulsion 
                    of <span class="orgName-JESUITS">Jesuits</span>. The scholars migrated first to <span class="placeName-BRUGES">Bruges</span>, and then to <span class="placeName-LIEGE">Liège</span>. 
                    The <span class="orgName-LIEGEACADEMY">Liège Academy</span> was disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, and the scholars again migrated in 1794 to 
                    <span class="orgName-STONYHURST">Stonyhurst</span> in <span class="placeName-LANCASHIRE">Lancashire</span>, an estate donated by a former pupil as a permanent home for the school 
                    (see <a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#CHADWICKSTOMERS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Chadwick, <i>St. Omers to Stonyhurst</i></a>). 
                    For the Protestant Ruskins, the former site of the school at <span class="placeName-STOMER">Saint&#x2010;Omer</span> would 
                    have borne the melodramatic association that some of its scholars allegedly participated in the Gunpowder Plot&#x2014;the only fact about the school mentioned by 
                    <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span> in his 1836 guidebook to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>

      <span id="CASSELLSHILLGLOSS"><i>Cassells hill</i>&#x2014;From <span class="placeName-CALAIS">Calais</span>, 
                    <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span> lay thirteen and three&#x2010;quarters miles or two and a half posts, with <span class="placeName-STOMER">Saint&#x2010;Omer</span> along the way at eleven miles or two posts, 
                    according to <span class="persName-JM">John Murray</span>&#x02BC;s guidebook to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>. <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> highlights <span class="placeName-CASSEL">Cassel</span> as 
                    &#x201C;most agreeably situated on a hill commanding a view much celebrated in <span class="placeName-FRANCE">France</span>, but which, after all, 
                    will bear no comparison with that from the <span class="geogName-MALVERNHILLS">Malvern Hills</span> in <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span>. It extends over the flat and fertile plains of <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span>, 
                    and as far as the white cliffs of <span class="placeName-ENGLAND">England</span> into 3 kingdoms; includes 32 towns and 100 villages. 
                    <span class="geogName-MONTCASSEL">Mont Cassel</span> was one of principal bases of the great trigonometrical survey carried on during the reign of <span class="persName-NBE">Napoleon</span>&#x201D;

      <span id="PRIESTLYORDERSGLOSS"><i>Priestly orders wound their way</i>&#x2014;Perhaps the Ruskins witnessed the procession of Corpus Christi, 
                    which is held sixty days after Easter to commemorate the real presence of <span class="persName-JESUSCHRIST">Christ</span> in the Eucharist. 
                    The canopy, which <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> mentions in his poem and shows in his tailpiece drawing, shelters the sacrament carried in a monstrance by a priest and his attendants. 
                    In 1833, <span class="persName-FMT">Frances Trollope</span> described such a procession in <span class="placeName-OSTEND">Ostend</span>: 
                    &#x201C;I rejoiced to find myself, on the 9th of June, in so very <span class="orgName-ROMANCATHOLICCHURCH">Catholic</span> a country; 
                    for the ceremonies by which the <i>Fête&#x2010;Dieu</i> was celebrated 
                    were really splendid, considering the size of the town. The streets were lined with double rows of young straight&#x2010;grown fir&#x2010;trees; 
                    every house being charged with the expense of purchasing such, and having them stuck in for the occasion. 
                    In the open places of the city, groups of these same slender trees supported wreaths and garlands of flowers, 
                    under which the host was carried in a splendid ark. The Curé, who bore this in his hands, 
                    was himself superbly dressed; and at each corner of the canopy, borne above his head, walked a child of four or five years old, 
                    in fancy costume, that looked as if it had been arranged by a ballet&#x2010;master. 
                    Three of them had wings; and the fourth, dressed as an infant <span class="persName-STJOHN">St. John</span>, would have been a beautiful model for a painter. 
                    The procession consisted of all the military in the garrison, a numerous cortège of priests, 
                    with their attendants, and the various associated companies of the town. 
                    But by far the prettiest part of the spectacle consisted of the double row of little girls, elegantly dressed in white, 
                    their heads adorned with wreaths of roses, and long white veils. Above two hundred of these pretty creatures, 
                    looking all smiles and gladness, followed the host; and when the procession paused, 
                    while the awful symbol was laid on the altar of the different <i>reposoirs</i> prepared to receive it, 
                    they, as well as the assembled multitude who followed them, prostrated themselves upon the ground before it. 
                    The children all visited the Curé in his sacristy as soon as the ceremony was over, 
                    and each received from him a little <i>cornet</i> of <i>bonbons</i>&#x201D;
