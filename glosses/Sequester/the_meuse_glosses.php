                    at least two poems by <a href="../notes/scott_walter_note.php" target="_blank" class="inactive"><span class="persName-WS">Walter Scott</span> (1771&#x2013;1832)</a>. 
                    In one, <span class="title-poem-SCOTTMASSACREOFGLENCOE">&#x201C;On the Massacre of Glencoe&#x201D;</span> (<span class="date-1814">1814</span>), a minstrel names things 
                    that retain &#x201C;lone security,&#x201D; such as the &#x201C;mist&#x2010;wreath&#x201D; which &#x201C;has the mountain&#x2010;crest,&#x201D; 
                    as opposed to the slain and dispersed Highland victims of the <span class="placeName-GLENCOE">Glencoe</span> massacre, who were betrayed on account of their Jacobite loyalties 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.html#SCOTTWORKSCALEDONIAN" target="_blank" class="inactive">Scott, <i>Works</i></a>, 50:151). 
                    The other poem, <span class="title-poem-SCOTTDONRODERICK"><i>The Vision of Don Roderick</i></span> (<span class="date-1811">1811</span>), 
                    may bear greater intertextual interest for <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem than merely providing a source of poetic diction. 
                    <span class="persName-WS">Scott</span> composed his poem as a heroic ode in Spenserian stanzas, 
                    in support of relief to <span class="placeName-PORTUGAL">Portugal</span> during the <span class="date-1807-1814">Peninsular War</span>. 
                    In the poem, <span class="persName-DRK">Don Roderick</span>, &#x201C;the last Gothic King of Spain,&#x201D; descends into an enchanted &#x201C;ancient vault, . . . 
                    the opening of which had been denounced as fatal to the Spanish Monarchy.&#x201D; Here, the king witnesses a vision of three future periods of crisis in the <span class="geogName-IBERIA">Iberian peninsula</span>, 
                    the last involving the &#x201C;unparalleled treachery of <span class="persName-NBE">Bonaparte</span>.&#x201D; In <span class="persName-DRK">Don Roderick</span>&#x02BC;s vision, 
                    the attempted usurpation by the French is thwarted by &#x201C;the arrival of the British succours.&#x201D; As the vision dissipates, 
                    the narrator looks forward to a triumphant conclusion: &#x201C;though the Vault of Destiny be gone, / 
                    King, prelate, all the phantasms of my brain, / Melted away like mist&#x2010;wreaths in the sun, / Yet grant for faith, for valour, 
                    and for <span class="placeName-SPAIN">Spain</span>, / One note of pride and fire, a patriot&#x02BC;s parting strain!&#x201D;

                    Line 10 of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>&#x02BC;s poem may allude to such a vision of history, the &#x201C;fairy vision of a dream,&#x201D;

                    greeted &#x201C;the first picturesque landscape we had looked upon since we entered <span class="placeName-BELGIUM">Belgium</span>. A little bright, meandering stream, 
                    a beetling rock of mountain limestone hanging over it, with a most Udolpho&#x2010;like&#x2010;looking castle in the woods beyond, 
                    formed a perfect treat for . . . picturesque&#x2010;seeking travellers, who, for the last month, 
                    had seen nothing but the level plains of <span class="placeName-FLANDERS">Flanders</span>, <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span>, and <span class="placeName-BRABANT">Brabant</span>. . . . 
                    The approach to <span class="placeName-NAMUR">Namur</span> is magnificent. The town lies in a basin at the juncture of the 
                    <span class="geogName-SAMBRE">Sambre</span> and the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>. At the angle formed by this &#x2018;meeting of the waters&#x2019; is the bold, 
                    abrupt termination of the long range of hills, running between them; 
                    and on the summit of this lofty eminence stands the citadel, with its superb works, stretching over the whole face of the mountain&#x201D;

                    when recording a family journey from <span class="placeName-HUY">Huy</span> to <span class="placeName-NAMUR">Namur</span> in <span class="date-1828">1828</span>: &#x201C;In the ruder parts of the rocky defile 
                    are seen the mantling ivy and numerous creepers climbing up the steep sides, which, with the lofty pinnacles and crested summits, give to these masses of rock 
                    the appearance of a succession of ruined castles, that are scarcely to be distinguished by the eye from those ancient fabrics, which are actually existing, 
                    and which may occasionally be seen peeping through the dense woods, or perched on the very pinnacle of some rocky eminence. In some places, either by the wasting away 
                    of the earth or loose materials, or by the working of the quarrymen, huge masses of naked rock are seen as if suspended in the air, or supported on so small a base, 
                    as to appear to threaten the traveller below with momentary danger of rolling down into the road&#x201D;

                    in these cliffs and fortifications &#x201C;the great barrier on the side of France; the work of centuries to erect, at the cost of vast sums of money, 
                    and as vast an expenditure of blood.&#x201D; The fortresses at <span class="placeName-NAMUR">Namur</span> and <span class="placeName-HUY">Huy</span> had been

                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> added, however, that the works had been less kept up recently, owing to &#x201C;the <span class="date-1830-08-25-1831-07-14">revolution of 1830</span>&#x201D;

                    it boasted two main bridges in the <span class="date-1830-1839">1830s</span>. What <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> calls the &#x201C;long&#x201D; bridge was the western one, 
                    spanning the <span class="geogName-MEUSE">Meuse</span>, the much wider of the two rivers. From the far bank, on the road to <span class="placeName-HUY">Huy</span> and

                    backward glance at the &#x201C;rich dome of the cathedral&#x201D; may refer to the late&#x2010;baroque dome of the <span class="title-architecture-STAUBIN">cathedral of St. Aubin</span>, 
                    a relatively modern church that, <span class="persName-SJB">Barrow</span> notes, had suffered the &#x201C;bad usage of the French soldiery, who converted it into a barrack and a hospital,&#x201D; 
                    but that was now &#x201C;kept in a state of good repair and perfect neatness.&#x201D; The other principal church was the baroque edifice of the Jesuit church, 
                    <span class="title-architecture-STLOUP">St. Loup</span>, which was not domed, but which was celebrated for its carved&#x2010;stone interior vault&#x2014;as

                    a far different spectacle than a fifteenth&#x2010;century romance. <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> continues: &#x201C;The manufacturing city&#x201D; of <span class="placeName-LIEGE">Liège</span>

                    proclaimed as such by &#x201C;the clouds of smoke usually seen from a distance hanging over it&#x201D;; and &#x201C;the dirty houses, murky atmosphere, 
                    and coal&#x2010;stained streets, are the natural consequence of the branch of industry in which its inhabitants are engaged.&#x201D; As chief among these industries, 
                    <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> singles out the manufacture of firearms and of machinery, iron foundaries, saddlery and coarse cloth production.
