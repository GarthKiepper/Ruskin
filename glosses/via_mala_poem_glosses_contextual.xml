                    <p>While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not subdivide his list into clusters, his intention is evident in that he drafted poems, 
                        which correspond to the titles, as an identically ordered sequence in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>. (One cannot tell from the list 
                        whether its titles refer to individual poems, as drafted in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, or to proposed composite sections, 
                        of which those poems would have formed a part&#x2014;the list providing no indication of intended genres.) The first title in this conjectural cluster, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title>, was drafted elsewhere, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</title>,

                    <p>Comparing <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, one sees that the younger poet&#x02BC;s 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title> serves the function of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, although <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> situates his poem 
                        as an introduction to the mountain&#x2010;pass sequence, rather than as reflective recollection, as <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> does in his poem. 
                        In <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                        the narrator reflects on history, including <persName corresp="#HANNIBAL">Hannibal</persName>&#x02BC;s crossing the <geogName corresp="#THEALPS">Alps</geogName>, 
                        which <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> made the subject of his vignette for the poem in the <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSITALY1830">1830 edition of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                        and which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> likewise developed as the topic of his poem. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> begins his poem 
                        with a reflection, however, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> separates out and makes the subject of its own poem&#x2014;the first sighting of the <geogName corresp="#THEALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                        from <placeName corresp="#SCHAFFHAUSEN">Schaffhausen</placeName>, celebrated in 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace that aye&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;]</title> 
                        (see the latter poem&#x02BC;s contextual notes, for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s allusion to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s lines in <title type="poem" corresp="ROGERSTHEALPS">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                        commemorating the first view).</p>
                    
                    <p>According to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                        his grand scheme was to place the topic of the first sighting of the <geogName corresp="#THEALPS">Alps</geogName> in one or both of two items, 
                        <title type="composite" corresp="#JRSCHAFFHAUSENCOMP">&#x201C;Schaffhausen&#x201D;</title> and <title type="composite" corresp="#JRTHEALPSCOMP">&#x201C;The Alps&#x201D;</title>, 
                        which fall amid a sequence of items leading up to the <placeName corresp="#SPLUGEN">Spl&#x00FC;gen Pass</placeName> crosssing, 
                        treating sites from <placeName corresp="#STRASBOURG">Strasbourg</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#CONSTANCE">Constance</placeName> 
                        (see the contextual glosses for <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                        Most of these pieces were never composed, or do not survive, but in <title type="manuscript">MS VIII</title> he composed an untitled poem, 
                        which in its content clearly corresponds to either of two proposed items&#x2014;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRALPSFROMSSCHAFFHAUSENPOEM">&#x201C;There is a charmed peace that aye&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Alps from Schaffhausen&#x201D;]</title>. 
                        In <title type="manuscript">MS VIII</title>, this draft poem immediately precedes the draft for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRVIAMALA">&#x201C;Via Mala&#x201D;</title>. 
                        Thus, in practice, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> thought of his writing about the first sighting of the <geogName corresp="#THEALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                        as immediately preliminary to the writing about crossing the mountains, but he steadily expanded what <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> treats as a single arc, 
                        with the narrator alternating between the time of present viewing and recollected time, both of his own recent past and of history and story. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> tends, in contrast, to string out the narrator&#x02BC;s experience as a succession of real&#x2010;time observations, 
                        each stage represented in a separate poem; and he attenuated that string of observations by adding more proposed sites for poems (or prose pieces, or composites) 
                        in that part of his <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php"><title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#JRPROPOSEDTABLEOFCONTENTS">Plan for Continuation of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title></ref>.</p></note>

                    Similarly, in his <date when="1838">1838</date> guidebook to <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, 
                    <persName corresp="#GS">George Smith III</persName> taught British tourists to anticipate the <geogName corresp="#VIAMALA">Via Mala</geogName> as,

                    <p>The feature in the scene that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopts as his focus for his poem&#x2014;the foaming of the swollen yet narrowly confined

                        The precipices, which often rise perpendicularly on both sides of it, are certainly in some places 1600 ft. high, and, in many places, not more than 10 yards apart. 
                        The <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, compressed within this narrow, stony bed to the width of a pigmy rivulet, is barely audible as it rushes 
                        through the depths below the road. The rocks of slate and limestone, composing the walls of the ravine, are so hard that they appear to have suffered no disintegration 
                        from the weather; the fracture is so fresh and sharp that, were the convulsive force from below, which divided them, again called forth to unite them, 
                        it seems as though the gulf would close and leave no aperture behind. When the traveller enters the mouth of the defile, the sudden transition from the glare 
                        of sunshine, to the gloom of a chasm so narrow that it leaves but a strip of sky visible overhead, is exceedingly striking&#x201D; (p. 206).</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite these terrors, the sublime experience was rendered safe for travelers in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> by a road that provided, 
                        as <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary</persName> remarked with her usual chauvinism, a &#x201C;surface . . . as good as any road in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Great Britain</placeName>&#x201D; 
                        (p. 40). The new carriage road with a parapet, completed in <date when="1821">1821</date>, is credited by <persName corresp="#GS">Smith</persName> to an Italian engineer, 
                        <persName corresp="#GLP">Giulio Pocobelli</persName> (<date notBefore="1766" notAfter="1843">1766&#x2013;1843</date>)&#x2014;although the honor may properly belong 
                        to his assistant, <persName corresp="#RLN">Richard La Nicca</persName> (<date notBefore="1794" notAfter="1883">1794&#x2013;1883</date>)&#x2014;who blasted 
                        a tunnel through a &#x201C;projecting buttress of rock which had previously denied all access. . . . The view looking back from this through the dark vista 
                        of black rock and the fringe of firs upon the ruined <placeName type="building" corresp="#HOHENRATIENCASTLE">tower of Realt [Castle Hohen R&#x00E4;tien]</placeName> 
                        and the sun&#x2010;lit <geogName corresp="#DOMLESCHG">valley of Domleschg</geogName> is very pleasing.&#x201D; Beyond the tunnel, 
                        &#x201C;the road is protected by a parapet wall below which at a depth of many hundred feet the contracted <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> 
                        frets the foot of the precipice&#x201D; (p. 207).</p></note>
