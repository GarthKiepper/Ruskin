                    gave the title "Lago Maggiore" to this poem, which is untitled in MS VIII draft. Collingwood does not justify this choice in his notes on the "Account"; 
                    but while no definitive internal evidence sanctions this identification, one can guess that Lago Maggiore was suggested to the editor by elements of the poet's description, 
                    as noted in the contextual glosses.</p></note>

                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRSOBROADLYSTRETCHED">"So broadly stretched in sapphire sheet"</title>, which appear on 78v of MS VIII, to the end of 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLAGOMAGGIORE">"It was an eve of summer mild" ["Lago Maggiore"]</title>. In MS VIII, the eight lines on 78v are enclosed in parentheses--marks 
                    that may or may not have been made by Ruskin, and that are unclear in their significance; otherwise, no meta-discursive indication in the manuscript connects the two line groups.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the Library Edition, the editors reprinted Collingwood's text, including the interpolated lines, likewise without comment. They did compare the added lines 
                        with the MS VIII witness, however, as indicated by their correcting Collingwood's version of the line, "Another heaven beneath our feet", to 
                        "Another heaven 'neath our feet", preserving Ruskin's contraction as found in the manuscript witness.</p>
