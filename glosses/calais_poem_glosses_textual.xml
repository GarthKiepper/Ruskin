                    as the reading is neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D;

                    As a substitution, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> devised his own line, printing it in square brackets, as shown in the <date when="1891">1891</date> witness, 
                    <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_poems_1891.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x2018;Calais&#x2019; [poem]</title></ref>. 
                    The editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> disagreed; and in 
                    the <date when="1903">1903</date> witness of <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msia_g1.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title></ref>, 
                    they restored <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original line, 
                    arguing that &#x201C;the young author, as we have seen in the case of the <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x2018;Iteriad&#x2019;</title></ref>, 
                    was not always careful to get a true rhyme, and [that] the meaning [of the original line 2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x2018;Calais&#x2019;</title>] is clear enough&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:341 n. 2).</p>
                    
                    <p>In hypothesizing a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> evidently meant a draft version preceding not only 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIX">MS IX</title> fair&#x2010;copy witness of <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msix.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title></ref>, 
                        but also the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, witness of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title>&#x2014;the 
                        earliest extant version, which is in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, and which shows interlinear corrections by his son. 
                        In the latter version, line 2 is identical to that in the fair&#x2010;copy version. That <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was familiar with the 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version, 
                        and was referring to this manuscript as the one containing the &#x201C;original&#x201D; version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title>, 
                        is indicated by his having accepted lines 5&#x2013;6 as originally composed in that version, in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                        and by his implicitly rejecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revision of those lines in that same <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version.
                        The manuscript holding the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version is presently the sole surviving manuscript source 
                        of lines 5&#x2013;6, which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> preferred, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having carried his own, 
                        not his father&#x02BC;s, version of these lines to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy.</p>
                    
                    <p>In arriving at his published version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title>, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                        appears therefore to have based his editorial decisions on his own aesthetic judgment, since his choices overall are consistent neither with the &#x201C;original&#x201D; 
                        in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand nor with the final version in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, 
                        even substituting a line of his own invention where he dislikes both versions. The editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, seem somewhat more consistent 
                        in preferring <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final, fair&#x2010;copy version, although their decisions are as eclectic and aesthetically driven as 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s in accepting the latter&#x02BC;s re&#x2010;punctuation of the poem in combination with some punctuation 
                        found in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair copy. <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                        clearly, too, had access to the witnesses &#x201C;in both the rough and in the fair copy&#x201D;, as they call them&#x2014;meaning, by the &#x201C;rough&#x201D; witness, 
                        what they called <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy&#x201D;, 
                        which is the manuscript containing the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:341 n. 2).</p>
                    
                    <p>By <date when="1903">1903</date>, the manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version must have been bound as part of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="apparatus_msia.html">MS IA</ref>, a compilation that <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                        added to Collingwood&#x02BC;s list of manuscripts in &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; 
                        (the &#x201C;Note&#x201D; in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html">Library Edition</ref> being 
                        &#x201C;revised and completed from the edition of 1891&#x201D;). 
                        This manuscript, at least, would have been included in what the editors identify among the contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="apparatus_msia.html">MS IA</ref>
