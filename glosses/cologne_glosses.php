      <span id="RUBENSBIRTHPLACEGLOSS">&#x201C;And this is the birthplace of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>!&#x201D; (MS VIII; MS IX; <i>Works</i> &#x005B;1903&#x005D;)&#x2014;The birthplace 
                    of <span class="persName-PPR">Peter Paul Rubens</span> (<span class="date-1577-1640">1577&#x2013;1640</span>) has been disputed since the seventeenth century, 
                    when writers made claims for both <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span> and <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. 
                    The controversy became heated in <span class="date-1853">1853</span>, thirty years after the Ruskins&#x02BC; visit, 
                    when a Dutch historian uncovered a story about <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC;s father, who was arrested for an adulterous affair with <span class="persName-AOS">Anna of Saxony</span>, imprisoned, 
                    and then sent to <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span> in <span class="placeName-WESTPHALIA">Westphalia</span>, 
                    where he lived under conditions of house arrest. He was joined in <span class="date-1573">1573</span> by his wife and children, who had been living in <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>. According to this account, 
                    the family stayed in <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span> until <span class="date-1578">1578</span>, a year after <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC;s birth, and then they returned to <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span>, 
                    where <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> spent his boyhood until <span class="date-1589">1589</span>. In that year, his father died, and the family relocated to <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span>. 
                    These revelations of the affair in the nineteenth century&#x2014;far from settling the question of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC;s birthplace, by placing the event logically in <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span>&#x2014;only 
                    fired the respective champions of <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> and <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span> to defend their claims. Scholarly debate on the subject persists to the present day, but <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span> the most persuasive arguments 
                    point to <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span>.<br/>
         
         <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> may have become known as the birthplace not only because <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> definitely grew up there, 
                    but also because his mother connived at identifying the city as the family&#x02BC;s continuous residence prior to her husband&#x02BC;s death and the move to <span class="placeName-ANTWERP">Antwerp</span>. 
                    She had strong motives to suppress the family&#x02BC;s associations with <span class="placeName-SIEGEN">Siegen</span>, since exposure of the scandal of her husband&#x02BC;s love affair 
                    would have disastrously damaged her family&#x02BC;s fortunes. The house in <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> that was marked 
                    for tourists as the birthplace was the <span class="placeName-building-GRONSFELDERHOF">Gronsfelder Hof</span>, no. 10, in the <span class="placeName-STERNENGASSE">Sternengasse</span>, a mansion that was also known for providing a refuge for 
                    <span class="persName-MDM">Marie de&#x02BC; Medici</span> in the final years of her exile from the French court

                    The <span class="persName-MDM">French queen</span> was a major patron of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, as was another seventeenth&#x2010;century resident of the <span class="placeName-STERNENGASSE">Sternengasse</span>, the important collector 
                    <span class="persName-EJIV">Everhard Jabach IV</span>. He commissioned <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC;s altarpiece painting for the cathedral, the <span class="title-artwork-RUBENSCRUCIFIXIONSTPETER"><i>Crucifixion of Saint Peter</i></span> (see below).</span><br><br>

                    (MS VIII; MS IX; <i>Works</i> &#x005B;1903&#x005D;)&#x2014;The <span class="title-artwork-RUBENSCRUCIFIXIONSTPETER"><i>Crucifixion of Saint Peter</i></span>,

                    <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> painted this harrowing work for the high altar of the church in which he was probably confirmed as a boy, and in which his father was entombed. 
                    In the picture, <span class="persName-PPR">Peter</span> is martyred by being nailed by his feet and hands while being hung upside down on a cross. 
                    While the personal connections were compelling for <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, with <span class="persName-PPR">Peter</span>₼s upside&#x2010;down cross effectively pointing at his father₼s tomb, 
                    the commission came from the collector, <span class="persName-EVJIV">Everhard Jabach IV</span>, who was interested more in creating an epitaph 
                        for his own father. A tradition relayed by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>, therefore, that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> 
                        &#x201C;bequeathed . . . &#x005B;the altarpiece&#x005D; at his death to his native city&#x201D; 
                        is not accurate. Nonetheless, <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> overrode his patron₼s suggestions for more dignified subjects 
                        from <span class="persName-PPR">Peter</span>₼s life in favor of this scene. 
                        Along with any personal significance the subject may have held for <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, artistic fame was also connected with the subject, 
                        which had prompted competition among painters in the sixteenth and the earlier seventeenth centuries 
                        (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#SAUERLANDERCATHOLICRUBENS" target="_blank" class="inactive">Sauerländer, <i>The Catholic Rubens</i></a>, 219&#x2013;32).<br/>
         
         <span class="persName-">Joshua Reynolds</span> did not admire the <span class="title-artwork-RUBENSCRUCIFIXIONSTPETER"><i>Crucifixion</i></span> 
                        in particular, although his appraisal of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> overall rose in approval over time (see below),. 
                    In <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSJOURNEY">A Journey to Flanders and Holland</span> (<span class="date-1797">1797</span>), <span class="persName-">Reynolds</span> 
                    acknowledged that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> expressed &#x201C;his own approbation of this picture,&#x201D; which was &#x201C;painted a little time 
                    before <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC;s death,&#x201D; and which the painter declared &#x201C;the best he ever painted.&#x201D; Thanks to this comment, 
                    the painting held &#x201C;great fame,&#x201D; <span class="persName-">Reynolds</span> admitted, and he traveled from <span class="placeName-DUSSELDORF">Düsseldorf</span> to <span class="placeName-COLOGNE">Cologne</span> 
                    &#x201C;on purpose to see it; but it by no means recompenced us for our journey,&#x201D; for he considered parts of the figure &#x201C;ill drawn, or rather in a bad taste of drawing.&#x201D; 
                    &#x201C;Many parts of this picture are so feebly drawn, and with so tame a pencil, that I cannot help suspecting that <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> died before he had completed it, 
                    and that it was finished by some of his scholars&#x201D; (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#REYNOLDSWORKS1797" target="_blank" class="inactive">Reynolds, <i>Works</i> &#x005B;<span class="date-1797">1797</span>&#x005D;</a>, 2:111). 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span> appears unacquainted with this opinion; and indeed, the Ruskins may have been responding primarily to the fame bestowed on the painting 
                        by <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>&#x02BC;s own assessment of it. Another influence besides traditions presented to tourists was changing taste: 
                    the huge flow of Old Master paintings into <span class="placeName-BRITAIN">Britain</span> during the Napoleonic era had shifted taste from neoclassicism 
                    to &#x201C;the warmth and colour of Venetian, Dutch, and Flemish masters&#x201D; 
                    (<a href="../bibiliography/bibliography.php#HASKELLREDISCOVERIES" target="_blank" class="inactive">Haskell, <i>Rediscoveries in Art</i></a>, 87).<br/>
                    
                    According to accounts published <span class="date-1833-1836">1833&#x2013;36</span>&#x2014;in guidebooks to the <span class="geogName-CONTINENT">Continent</span>

                    was &#x201C;a most wretched copy&#x201D; of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>₼s <i>Crucifixion</i>, as <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span> warns, 
                    &#x201C;painted at the time when the original . . . was carried away to <span class="placeName-PARIS">Paris</span>&#x201D; during occupation by the French Republic. 
                    The painting was repatriated, however; and <span class="persName-JML">Leigh</span> describes how, &#x201C;for a small fee,&#x201D; the sacristan turned the frame on a pivot to display the original, mounted behind the copy. 
                    The original was regularly on view on Sundays and during festivals, according to <span class="persName-JM">Murray</span>

                    The Ruskins viewed the painting on a Monday, <span class="date-1833-05-27">27 May 1833</span>. In her diary, <span class="persName-MRC">Mary Richardson</span> 
                    described the &#x201C;expression of agony and resignation of <span class="persName-STPETER"></span>St Peter₼s face and the indifference in those of the executioners&#x201D; as &#x201C;wonderfully done&#x201D;&#x2014;a 
                    strange impression, given that the expression of the principle executioner, which is turned fully to viewer, shows demonic viciousness

                    for whatever reason, chose not to write about it, in later years his opinion of the painting did not improve. Privately, he wrote that he considered it among 
                    &#x201C;the most brutal and beastly pictures I ever saw in my life&#x201D;; and publicly, he listed it among the proofs that, in Counter&#x2010;Reformation painting, 
                    &#x201C;the Flemish and Dutch masters are always languid unless they are profane&#x201D;

      <span id="DISHONOURGLOSS">&#x201C;There is, in many, in most, of the pictures of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> . . . an unpleasingness, that does him dishonour&#x201D; 
                    (MS IX; <i>Works</i> &#x005B;1903&#x005D;)&#x2014;In British criticism of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>, a foundation was laid by <span class="persName-JRE">Jonathan Richardson</span> (<span class="date-1667-1745">1667&#x2013;1745</span>) 
                    in the <span class="title-book-RICHARDSONTHEORYOFPAINTING"><i>Essay on the Theory of Painting</i></span> (<span class="date-1715">1715</span>), 
                    in which <span class="persName-JRE">Richardson</span> followed the French critic, <span class="persName-RDP">Roger de Piles</span> (<span class="date-1635-1709">1635&#x2013;1709</span>), in assessing <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> in terms of the persistent academic debate over the merits of color versus line, 
                    personalized as the <i>rubenistes</i> versus the <i>poussinistes</i>, although <span class="persName-JRE">Richardson</span> listed <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> as a master in both categories. 
                    <span class="persName-SJR">Joshua Reynolds</span> (<span class="date-1723-1792">1723&#x2013;92</span>), in the <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSDISCOURSES"><i>Discourses</i></span>

                    In composition, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> asserts in Discourse 5, his &#x201C;art is too apparent,&#x201D; his figures exhibiting &#x201C;expression&#x201D; and &#x201C;energy,&#x201D; but lacking &#x201C;simplicity and dignity&#x201D;; and in coloring, there is

                    In <span class="date-1781">1781</span>, when <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> took a tour of the <span class="placeName-LOWCOUNTRIES">Low Countries</span>, his estimation of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> was raised by observing more of the painter₼s work. 
                    The change is summarized in <span class="title-essay-REYNOLDSRUBENS">&#x201C;Character of Rubens&#x201D;</span>, an essay within <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span>₼s notes from the tour, which were 
                    published posthumously as <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSJOURNEY">A Journey to Flanders and Holland</span> (<span class="date-1797">1797</span>). The &#x201C;Character of Rubens&#x201D; begins by challenging criticism 
                    with &#x201C;the works of men of genius,&#x201D; in which &#x201C;great faults are united with great beauties.&#x201D; As in Discourse 5, 
                    <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> understands <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> according to &#x201C;the genius which prevails and illuminates the whole,&#x201D; but 
                    the English critic goes on to develop his ideas oppositely to <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s, for now he finds: &#x201C;It is only in large compositions that his &#x005B;<span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>₼s&#x005D; 
                    powers seem to have room to expand themselves. . . . His superiority is not seen in easel pictures&#x201D;&#x2014;the more intimate scale preferred by <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>. 
                    <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span>₼s best works, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> goes on, 
                    &#x201C;flow with a freedom and prodigality, as if they cost him nothing.&#x201D; Respecting the traditional contest between color and line, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> reflects <span class="persName-JRE">Richardson</span>₼s assessment by placing <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> high in both categories: 
                    &#x201C;The striking brilliancy of his colours, and their lively opposition to each other, the flowing liberty and freedom of his outline, and animated pencil, 
                    with which every object is touched, all contribute to awaken and keep alive the attention of the spectator.&#x201D; Thus, a view that in the <span class="title-book-REYNOLDSDISCOURSES">Discourses</span> was offered as 
                    a concession, now reads as an inevitability: <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> achieves &#x201C;the complete uniformity in all the parts of the work,&#x201D; 
                    a unity that seems to &#x201C;grow out of one mind.&#x201D; The &#x201C;confidence&#x201D; of that mind places <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> above rules, which are &#x201C;subject to his control,&#x201D; 
                    rather than he being &#x201C;himself subject to the rules.&#x201D; His &#x201C;originality of manner&#x201D; can therefore &#x201C;be truly said to have extended the limits of the art.&#x201D;<br/>
                    
                    Even in the <span class="title-essay-REYNOLDSRUBENS">&#x201C;Character of Rubens&#x201D;</span>, however, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> admits to some shortcomings 
                    in <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s &#x201C;excellencies, which would have perfectly united with his style,&#x201D; and this list of failings 
                    possibly corresponds to some of <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s comments in <span class="title-essay-">&#x201C;Cologne&#x201D;</span>. 
                    In the figures, <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> finds wanting a &#x201C;poetical conception of character&#x201D;; and in his &#x201C;representations of the highest characters 
                    in the christian or the fabulous world, . . . the spectator finds little more than mere mortals, such as he meets with every day&#x201D;

                    and he followed <span class="persName-SJR">Reynolds</span> in reverencing the &#x201C;mind&#x201D; of the painter, 
                    although tempering this judgment with an early Victorian alertness for a lack of earnestness: &#x201C;I never have spoken, 
                    and I never will speak, of <span class="persName-PPR">Rubens</span> but with the most reverential feeling; and whatever imperfections in his art may have resulted from his unfortunate want of seriousness 
                    and incapability of true passion, his calibre of mind was originally such that I believe the world may see another <span class="persName-TV">Titian</span> &#x005B;<span class="date-1447-1576">1447&#x2013;1576</span>&#x005D;

                    The artist <span class="persName-JML">James Mathews Leigh</span>, who lodged in this hotel possibly in the same year as the Ruskins₼ tour, wrote with a sardonic edge similar to (if more easy going than) 
                    <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>₼s narrator about the German cuisine, and about the view from the &#x201C;brilliancy of the saloon at the <span class="placeName-building-RHEINBERGHOTEL">Grosse Rheinberg</span>&#x201D; with its &#x201C;nine lofty windows which overlook the <span class="geogName-RHINE">Rhine</span>.&#x201D;

                    <span class="persName-JML">Leigh</span> describes the view of the bridge of boats extending across the river, with its toll booth manned by Prussian guards,

                    of the gay and the idle of the inhabitants, who ever and anon profiting by the raising of the barrier, rushed to the scene of their enjoyment.&#x201D; 
                    As <span class="persName-JML">Leigh</span> watched, the promenaders₼ safety seemed threatened by the bridge parting to allow passage of huge raft carrying commercial provisions
