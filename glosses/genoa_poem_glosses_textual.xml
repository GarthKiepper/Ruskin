                <note xml:id="OFVARIOUSTREESGLOSS" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">&#x201C;Of various trees a vista green&#x201D; (MS VIII; <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [<date when="1891">1891</date>]; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> [1903])&#x2014;</hi>In 
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, the twenty-six lines beginning with this line appear on 64r-v, divided by a horizontal line from the preceding titled draft of the poem, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLAGODICOMO">"Lago di Como"</title>, and by a line space from the following untited poem, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLAGOMAGGIORE">"It was an eve of summer, mild" [<geogName corresp="#LAKEMAGGIORE">"Lago Maggiore"</geogName>]</title>. On 79r, the line 
                    &#x201C;Of various trees a vista green&#x201D; recurs, along with the two following lines from 64r, as lines 19-21 (numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 1395-97) of the titled draft of the poem, 
                    <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGENOA">"Genoa"</title>. There, the lines 19 and 21 are followed by "&#x0026;c" and "&#x0026;", respectively, 
                    apparently indicating that the full twenty-six lines on 64r-v are to be inserted at that designated point of the draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGENOA">"Genoa"</title>. 
                    The intention of these "etcetera" symbols is supported by the correspondingly metadiscursive symbol of four asterisks, 
                    which follow the final, twenty-sixth line of the earlier poem on 64r-v. Yet, despite these asterisks, no evidence definitively establishes that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> initially composed the twenty-six lines of 
                    &#x201C;Of various trees a vista green&#x201D; as a fragment destined specifically for <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGENOA">"Genoa"</title>, or that he composed these lines 
                    out of sequence and at a different time from the verse surrounding them. While the metadiscursive marks make <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s intentions clear enough for inserting the lines in the draft 
                    fifteen pages later, the twenty-six lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JROFVARIOUSTREES">&#x201C;Of various trees a vista green&#x201D;</title> assert a measure 
                    of ontological status as a poetic utterance. In <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> inserted the lines into <title type="poem" corresp="#JRGENOA">"Genoa"</title> 
                    without comment, and the editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> followed suit, without remarking the separation of the lines in the manuscript as a unit apart from the longer poem.</p>
                    
                    <p>Respecting the sequence of composition at this stage in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, one can broadly claim that, following draft of a cluster of poems concerning crossing the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName> 
                        (see <ref type="witness" corresp="passign_the_alps_msia_g2.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRPASSINGTHEALPSPOEM">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</title></ref> and glosses), 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> reverted to drafting prose for the earlier Belgian segment of the journey, presumably in order to keep pace with his simultaneous 
                        fair-copying and illustration of that portion of the "Account" in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title>. Interspersed with these essays, he introduced verse about northern <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>, 
                        his invention logically adverting first to the Italian lakes, as the geographical introduction to Italy following an Alpine crossing from the north. 
                        He composed a poem about <placeName corresp="#CHIAVENNA">Chiavenna</placeName>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JROHSOFTLYBLEW">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the morning breeze&#x201D;</title>, and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRLAGODICOMO">&#x201C;Lago di Como&#x201D;</title>, and then this poem about the journey south to <placeName corresp="#GENOA">Genoa</placeName>. 
                        He skipped writing here about <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, presumably because he had already composed <title type="poem" corresp="#MILANCATHEDRAL">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</title> 
                        in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIAG2">MS IA, g.2</title>. Thus, the vista of a &#x201C;rich and mighty plain&#x201D; that opens at the start of this poem 
                        refers to the country south of <placeName corresp="#MILAN">Milan</placeName>, and the poem surveys a wide panoramic arc from north to south.</p>

                    altered this phrase to "Hither and thither", and the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> silently accepted the emendation

                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:378). <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>'s additional modifier "fast" suggests, however, 
                    that he did intend that the "sportive light ran / Thither and thither fast", receding rapidly away from the spectator "through / That natural arched avenue", 
                    and not that the light ran randomly "hither and thither" on the surface of the water.</p></note><!--The pointer to this gloss would be <ref type="gloss" target="genoa_poem_glosses_textual.php#THITHERGLOSS"/>.-->

                    read a smeared word in the manuscript as "sun", and the Library Edition silently accepted this reading, though the intended word may be "snow"

                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:379). A definitive reading may not be possible, 
                    but the following adjectival phrases, "Wnite as the wreathed salt sea spray / With the the snow wreaths that ever press", read less redundantly 
                    if modifying the whiteness of sunlight rather than snow.</p></note><!--The pointer to this gloss would be <ref type="gloss" target="genoa_poem_glosses_textual.php#SUNGLOSS"/>.-->
