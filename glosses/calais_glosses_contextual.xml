                    As a substitution, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> devised his own line, printing it in square brackets, as shown in the <date when="1891">1891</date> witness. 
                    The editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref> disagreed; and in

                    they restored <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original line, 
                    arguing that &#x201C;the young author, as we have seen in the case of the <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRITERIAD">&#x2018;Iteriad&#x2019;</title></ref>, 
                    was not always careful to get a true rhyme, and [that] the meaning [of the original line 2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x2018;Calais&#x2019;</title>] is clear enough&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:341 n. 2).</p>
                    
                    <p>In hypothesizing a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> evidently meant a draft version preceding not only 
                        the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIX">MS IX</title> fair&#x2010;copy witness of <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msix.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title></ref>, 
                        but also the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title>, witness of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title>&#x2014;the 
                    earliest extant version, which is in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, and which shows interlinear corrections by his son. 
                    In the latter version, line 2 is identical to that in the fair&#x2010;copy version. That <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was familiar with the 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version, 
                        and was referring to this manuscript as the one containing the &#x201C;original&#x201D; version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title>, 
                    is indicated by his having accepted lines 5&#x2013;6 as originally composed in that version, in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                        and by his implicitly rejecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revision of those lines in that same <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version.
                        The manuscript holding the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version is presently the sole surviving manuscript source 
                        of lines 5&#x2013;6, which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> preferred, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having carried his own, 
                        not his father&#x02BC;s, version of these lines to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy.</p>
                    
                    <p>In arriving at his published version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRCALAIS">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]</title>, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                        appears therefore to have based his editorial decisions on his own aesthetic judgment, since his choices overall are consistent neither with the &#x201C;original&#x201D; 
                        in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand nor with the final version in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, 
                        even substituting a line of his own invention where he dislikes both versions. The editors of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, seem somewhat more consistent 
                        in preferring <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final, fair&#x2010;copy version, although their decisions are as eclectic and aesthetically driven as 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s in accepting the latter&#x02BC;s re&#x2010;punctuation of the poem in combination with some punctuation 
                        found in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair copy. <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                        clearly, too, had access to the witnesses &#x201C;in both the rough and in the fair copy&#x201D;, as they call them&#x2014;meaning, by the &#x201C;rough&#x201D; witness, 
                    what they called <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy&#x201D;, 
                        which is the manuscript containing the <title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIAG1">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</title> version 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:341 n. 2).</p>
                    
                    <p>By <date when="1903">1903</date>, the manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version must have been bound as part of

                        added to Collingwood&#x02BC;s list of manuscripts in &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;

                    (&#x201C;a little France, a miniature picture&#x201D;). Similarly, in her journal of the tour, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref>

                    portraying the port city in terms of British travelers&#x02BC; complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example, 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#HEATHSANNUAL1832"><hi rend="italic">Heath&#x02BC;s Picturesque Annual for <date when="1832">1832</date></hi></title>, which warns that, in <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>,

                    Whereas <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossing, into a topic for picturesque contrasts of scenery and costume, 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray III</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook emphasizes the comforts of familiarity: <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> &#x201C;is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken&#x201D;

                    however, is the older poet&#x02BC;s crowded historical references. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> uses the trope of the city gate to allude to the story in the
