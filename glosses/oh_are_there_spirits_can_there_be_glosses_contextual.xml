                <note xml:id="SPRITESINEARTHORAIR" resp="#DCH"><p><hi rend="bold">&#x201C;If there be sprites in earth or air, / They surely have their dwelling there&#x201D; (MS VIII)&#x2014;</hi>The 
                    poem seems suggested by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MANFRED">Manfred</persName>'s invocation of the "Spirits of Earth and Air" 
                    in Byron's <title type="drama" corresp="#BYRONMANFRED"><hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi></title> (I.i.41). The spirits' "dwelling there" in Ruskin's poem refers, 
                    probably, to the mountains, as in Manfred's call to &#x201C;Mysterious Agency! / Ye spirits of the unbounded Universe! / Whom I have sought in darkness and in light-- / Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell / 
                    In subtler essence--ye, to whom the tops / Of mountains inaccessible are haunts, / And earth's and ocean's caves familiar things--", although Byron's spirits haunt many places, 
                    "Earth, ocean, air, night, mountains, winds&#x201D; (McGann 4:54, 57 [I.i.28-34, 132]).</p>
                    
                    <p>An association with Byron's play may have been suggested by the account of the poet's 1816 Continental journey, which traced a path similar to the Ruskins', 
                    and which Ruskin could have read in Thomas Moore's edition of the <title type="book" corresp="#BYRONLETTERSANDJOURNALSMOORE">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</title>, which the family acquired in about December 1833, 
                    three months following their return home (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 231-32). 
                    In Moore's glossing of Byron's impressions of his Alpine journey with lines afterward composed for Manfred, he selects, 
                    however, only instances of the terrific and violent sublime, such as views of nature's ruin from the cliffs and glaciers of the Jungfrau 
                    (I.ii.66-69, 75-78, 85-87; II.iii.4-8) or of high cataracts in the valleys (II.i.1-8) 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BYRONLETTERSJOURNALSMOORE">Moore, ed., <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</hi></ref>, 2:232-34). By comparison, Ruskin's tone seems amazed but serene and reverential.</p>
                    
                    <p>These intertextual associations with Byron's Alpine journey, if accurate, support a case for this poem as belonging to the draft for the "Account" in MS VIII--a case that, because of the lines' physical position 
                        in the notebook, cannot be confirmed (see <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus#COMPOSITEILLUSTRATEDTRAVELOGUEDRAFT">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Drafting the Composite&#x2010;Genre Travelogue [MS VII, MS VIII, MS XI]</ref>).</p>
