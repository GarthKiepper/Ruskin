                <p>In &#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 1&#x201D;, when Mamma mentions that Papa has gone to the &#x201C;city&#x201D;, 
                    she refers to the &#x201C;general name for London within the gates and within the bars&#x201D; 
                    (Cunningham, <hi rend="italic">Hand-book of London</hi> 121). By the early
                    nineteenth century, the gates and bars had been removed, except for Temple Bar,
                    designed by Wren after the Great Fire.</p>

                    <p>For Walter Besant writing at the end of the nineteenth century, 
                        the district of the City where John James Ruskin worked was defined by the ancient boundaries of two gates, 
                        Aldgate in the east and Bishopsgate on the north. Leadenhall Market marked one of the district's oldest functions, 
                        while a more modern landmark was the headquarters of the East India Company. The district also contained the Jewish quarter 
                        (Besant, London City, 146). In Ruskin's youth, the East India House was the 1799 neoclassical structure, 
                        featuring an Ionic portico; and in the year of Ruskin's birth, James Mill began his career in the building, 
                        with his son, John Stuart, starting work there as a clerk four years later 
                        (Wheatley, London Past and Present, 2:2-3).</p>
                    <p>The business premises of Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq was located in Billiter Street, 
                        which runs between Leadenhall and Fenchurch Streets. Once called a lane, 
                        Billiter Street is very old, its structures having escaped the
                        Great Fire. By the eighteenth century, observers regarded the street's buildings as antiquated and "mean" 
                        except for those built in their own time in Billiter Square, on the west side of the street. 
                        Billiter Square square was considered &#x201C;airy&#x201D; and lined with &#x201C;good new brick buildings, 
                        very well inhabited&#x201D;, according to eighteenth-century sources quoted 
                        in the 1850 Hand-book of London, which also notes that, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
                        those residences were gradually converted to businesses 
                        (Cunningham, <hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book of London</hi>, 54; 
                        Besant, <hi rend="italic">London City</hi>, 150). 
                        One of these respectable buildings in Billiter Sreet was owned by Henry Telford, 
                        who became the sleeping partner in the firm of Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq 
                        (Hilton, John Ruskin: The Early Years, 6).</p>
                    <p>In the 1820s and 1830s, besides John James's firm, other import businesses were headquartered in the neighborhood, 
                        such as the large West India House, which operated the West India Docks 
                        (Chancellor, <hi rend="italic">Squares of London</hi> 385). For such companies, 
                        Billiter Street was convenient to the London Docks, which were situated east of the nearby Tower of London. 
                        A more auspicious neighbor for Ruskin's career was the shop of Smith, Elder, 
                        first located in Fenchurch Street, around the corner from Billiter Street, 
                        where the company supplied stationery to the East India Company, 
                        and later located in Cornhill, where the company went on to develop its publishing arm 
                        (see Smith, Elder, &#x0026; Company).</p>
                    <p>According to the 1891 updated edition of the Hand-book of London, 
                        toward the end of the nineteenth century Billiter Street became "very different" 
                        with the erection of "large and lofty piles of offices" and "a handsome avenue opened to Lime street", 
                        which runs parallel to Billiter Street (Wheatley, London Past and Present, 1:185).</p>

                    <p>In &#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol. 1&#x201D;, Mamma remarks to Lucy that Papa has &#x201C;got to go to
                        . . . the city and then to the docks&#x201D; (chap. 1), and Ruskin later
                        includes an illustration, &#x201C;Harry’s Dock,&#x201D; [Plate] &#x201C;8,&#x201D; [&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol.
                        1] <!--Correction needed here?-->. By the mid&#x2010;1820s, new docks had been recently completed or were under
                        construction to help move the enormous increase in trade. Shortly prior to these
                        developments, Thomas Pennant described Blackwall and Wapping as miles of
                        streets, &#x201C;inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men, alternate occupants of sea
                        and land: their floating tenements . . . before them. In fact, the whole river,
                        from the bridge, for a vast way, is covered with a double forest of masts, with
                        a narrow avenue in mid-channel&#x201D; (Pennant, <hi rend="italic">History of
                            London</hi> 2:56). Since the later eighteenth century, congestion on the
                        river had became unbearable, permitting huge losses to thievery. Consequently,
                        the engineering feat of the new docks was considered among the great
                        testimonials to England’s commercial might (Margetson, <hi rend="italic">Regency
                            London</hi> 21). </p>
                    <p>The West India and East India docks, which handled trade to and from those
                        regions, the Surrey dock system, and the London Dock at Wapping were all built
                        within the first decade of the nineteenth century. As Ruskin was writing his
                        &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; volumes, the St. Katherine Dock was under construction near the
                        Tower, with the warehouses built directly on the water. It opened in 1828
                        (Broodbank, <hi rend="italic">Port of London</hi>, 1:155, 161). </p>
                    <p>John James Ruskin presumably did his business primarily at the London Dock in
                        Wapping, since for a time it held a monopoly on tobacco, rice, wine and brandy,
                        other than the Indies trade. Built on twenty acres, it opened in 1805
                        (Broodbank, <hi rend="italic">Port of London</hi>, 1:114, 117, 140). A plate in
                        Broodbank (1:113 opp.) shows an inlet from the river opening to a large, square
                        basin, where ships could dock side by side. The basin was surrounded by large
                        warehouses. </p>
                    <p>The appearance of warehouses was determined by &#x201C;requirements of structural
                        stability and fire protection,&#x201D; and remained consistent from the Great Fire of
                        the seventeenth century through the twentieth century. Materials were brick,
                        timber for floors, and tiles or slate for roofs, although cast iron was used for
                        columns and reinforcements from the early 1800s. Of interest for the Ruskin
                        firm, for wine and spirits at the London docks &#x201C;an important feature . . . was
                        the vaults . . . beneath quay level.&#x201D; These were wide barrel vaults resting on
                        stone or cast&#x2010;iron columns (Tucker, &#x201C;Warehouses in Dockland&#x201D; 22, 24, 26). </p>
                    <p>Transport from the city to the docks was at first by omnibus. River steamers were
                        in service by the mid&#x2010;1830s; and soon thereafter, rail lines, among the first in
                        the kingdom, ran to Greenwich and Blackwall (Pearsall, &#x201C;Dockland Transport&#x201D;
                        145&#x2013;46). For John James, the trip would not have been far from the premises of
                        Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq, which were housed in Billiter Street (see City of
                        London).</p>
