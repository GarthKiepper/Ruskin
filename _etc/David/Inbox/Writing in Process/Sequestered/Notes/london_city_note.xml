                <p>In &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1, when Mama mentions that Papa has gone to the &#x201C;city,&#x201D; 
                    she refers to the &#x201C;general name for London within the gates and within the bars&#x201D; 
                    (Cunningham, <hi rend="italic">Hand-book of London</hi> 121). By the early
                    nineteenth century, the gates and bars had been removed, except for Temple Bar,
                    designed by Wren after the Great Fire. </p>
                <p>The business premises of Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq were located near Aldgate,
                    the eastern edge of the City, in Billiter Street, between Leadenhall and
                    Fenchurch Streets. The lane, Billiter Street, was very old, having escaped the
                    Great Fire, but considered mean by an eighteenth-century observers, except for
                    the Billiter Square of their own time, which was &#x201C;airy&#x201D; and lined with &#x201C;good new
                    brick buildings, very well inhabited&#x201D; (Besant, <hi rend="italic">London
                        City</hi> 150; Cunningham, <hi rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book of London</hi> 54).
                    These formerly elegant residences in the square were, by the early nineteenth
                    century, giving way to businesses, including importing concerns, such as West
                    India House, which operated the West India Docks (Chancellor, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Squares of London</hi> 384&#x2013;85). For such companies as Ruskin, Telford, and
                    Domecq, the convenience of Billiter Street would have been its vicinity to the
                    London Docks, which lay east of the nearby Tower of London.</p>
