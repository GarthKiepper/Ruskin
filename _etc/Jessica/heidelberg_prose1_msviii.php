                            winding beneath the twisted branches of green woods, with<br/>
                            here and there a grey crag lifting up its lichened head<br/>
                    from the wilderness of brake<span class="glosses"><a href="../glosses/heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#BRAKE" target="_blank"" class="inactive">2</a></span> and grass and flowr, that con&#x2010;<br/>

                            then emerging on narrow vallies, or steep and rocky dells,<br/> 
                            or lovely sweeps of dewy green sward, fresh and flowery,<br/>
                            as ever fairies circled on, and ending on a lofty terrace,<br/>
                            whose precipice base was begirt with meadow land,<br/>
                            at the point where a narrow mountain gorge opened<br/>
