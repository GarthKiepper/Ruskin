                    reaches the small village of <span class="placeName-WATERLOO">Waterloo</span>. Beyond this point the wood assumes a more straggling and dispersed appearance, 
                    until about a mile farther, where at an extended ridge, called the heights of <span class="geogName-MONTSAINTJEAN">Mount St John</span>, 
                    from a farm&#x2010;house situated upon the <span class="placeName-BRUSSELS">Brussels</span> road, the trees almost entirely disappear,

                    the tourist speaker finds the forest more somber and oppressive than does <span class="persName-JR">Ruskin</span>: &#x201C;Thy wood, dark <span class="placeName-SONIANFOREST">Soignies</span>, holds us now, / 
                    Where the tall beeches&#x02BC; glossy bough / For many a league around, / With birch and darksome oak between, / Spreads deep and far a pathless screen / 
                    Of tangled forest ground. / Stems planted close by stems defy / The adventurous foot&#x2014;the curious eye / 
                    For access seeks in vain; / And the brown tapestry of leaves, / Strewed on the blighted ground, receives / Nor sun nor air nor rain. / 
                    No opening glade dawns on our way, / No streamlet glancing to the ray / Our woodland path has corssed; / 
                    And the straight causeway which we tread / Prolongs a line of dull arcade, / Unvarying through the unvaried shade / Until in distance lost&#x201D;
